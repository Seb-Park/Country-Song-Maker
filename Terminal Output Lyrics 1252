 became just another one of the many "great" things done to help the poor, the sick, and those with disabilities.

In order to ensure that people would receive the fruits of their labor, we have put together a program, the Human Services Program.

The Human Services Program is a program that ensures that all Americans have access to and a right to health care services. A program that helps all Americans. We have a Human Services Program. The idea that we're trying to change people's lives, our lives. It's a program that has really changed everyone's lives.

The Human Services Program is a program that is also responsible for our health and safety for all of us. It's an important program, a program that helps people understand and become a part of the American way of life, by helping people understand, by becoming part of, or caring for themselves and others in ways that are not only the way we need to move forward but also the way we want to live our lives.

It's the most important program, there's no other name for it. There isn't even a word for it.

But a few of us were born on a farm in Montana and spent our life on that farm. And there are more than a few people whose lives aren't even close to that of those who are on this farm.

Now I want to share a few stories that we've shared. That you can follow or even have a look at on this website for more details on the program.

I am the wife of a man named Bob Hales. Bob is from Mississippi. He was born here on February 14, 1955 and was raised here in Kentucky. He and I grew up in a barn and farm in Tennessee, and we spent the rest of our lives together with three small children who loved watching the television and playing the radio.

I am my own worst enemy. I'm one of those people that you know is the way to go, and that you can change them all, and that I'm your worst friend.

And I am the best friend of all of us. And I think I'm the best friend ever to exist or ever will.

My name is Bob Hales, and I'm born in the Missouri Valley, about 18 miles north of Chattanooga on the Tennessee Valley, and my mother is a Methodist convert.

This is my story. It starts in the early 1950s and ends in the mid 1950s.

In the late 1950's and throughout the 1960s I spent time in the Kentucky area known as "The Kentucky Hill Country" for my Baptist denomination and other denominations that I've been affiliated with since the mid '50's and through the 1970's. I was introduced to the world of music in the early '50's by my cousin, Frank "Rockin' 'N' Roll" Johnson, who was a college sweetheart and a member of "The Club for Sturdy People" when we were little.

"I don't feel like a band anymore," Rockin' 'N' Roll once told me. "I'd rather be a band now that we all died and were buried as kids or something, for a lot less money and a lot less time." I had so much to learn from that place, but I was never sure that I would even have those things again.

From there on I went off to be a drummer in the church we once found. In my senior year I was brought back from school in a pickup.

"That was the only thing that could make me change my life," said Rockin' 'N' Roll. "God, I hated that pickup pickup pickup pickup pickup pickup. All I had to do was give up on it and go back to church like God said."

My mom, who now lives in Nashville and is a professor at Western Kentucky University, was an excellent teacher. She got along very well with Rockin' 'N' Roll, but he really was a rocker when we were kids. We'd play in the church when everybody else was gone, and then we were together and the guitar band was made for the house. My brother's first big band came out, and his band was a big hit there. And at some point Rockin' 'N' Roll became a band he'd do a little bit later on.

From there on we went on the road with rockin' and roll and music, and we got a taste of it when a friend and I were going through a really hard year for college. We moved through the back door of an American Express commercial, and we got some money from some college friends. We ended up buying some houses and homes in Tennessee, and we moved to Nashville and moved in with another friend.

"We lived down there, and my brother, a preacher, was getting into that church. We were walking with a friend, and one day I hear a guy say,

======== SAMPLE 3 ========
ases he had lost in the past and was in love with her. This was a woman who had spent her life doing nothing but get herself a job.
I'm married to a woman in my thirties, and it was a lot less than it did when I left her for the summer of 1967 after working late one night on the farm in Piscataway, New Jersey. There was more than just an affair going on in the backyard, and the couple had a three night affair in the garden, too. Both men had the same taste in music, fashion and fancy clothes, but the one thing they had in common was that they had a son, who is now an adult. I was surprised that she was able to take that into adulthood, I was even more surprised that he had no children on his father's side. I am now the mother or he has a son. When I'm gone, my son will grow old and cry in the yard. My wife and I have not the slightest say in our lives but I know we have to, because I'm out here. I love this little girl who is more than someone you can bet your life to do things for her, and she is now too old to give up her independence.
There are also some things I will never forget. I'm sorry I was lost, but I'll never get back to you. I'll always be here for you. But maybe I've got it all wrong, oh, a big hole in my heart that a friend can take you in, it's a lot to take in at once, if it's too much to take in. Maybe I've brought a whole world of shame upon you, I promise I won't do me the same. But maybe you can understand, maybe you can change it, maybe you can help this woman get her independence back, and maybe you can even just find someone else to be your husband or mother-in-law?<|endoftext|>One-armed and two-armed people
This was a game played in a high school classroom on Sunday, Feb. 26, 1992
I can only imagine what this world must feel like to live in it
There's no escape from it, it's hard to imagine not
You know what's so cool about this game
Playin' and playin' it the same way
You may have to be in school to play it
Oh yeah, you may have to play it as well
Oh don't take me for an angel, just a man
I have a feeling no one will let me go down this path
I feel like I'm about to turn the corner, but I can't
I can feel the tension in my heart
There is no escaping from it, it's hard to imagine not
I think I'm about to turn the corner, but I can't
I can feel the tension in my heart
Yeah, I'm about to turn the corner, there's no turning back
I'll try to find somewhere to be, but they're gone
I don't know what to tell you, well it's hard not to find someone
Oh, you may feel a little down in yourself
Don't be hard on them, sometimes they'll give a little somethin about you
Just don't let them take away the peace of the universe
I know it's easy to hate them, but keep 'em away
Don't let them take away your peace
Well, there's no going back, now's the time for you to be free
My little love has a way of doing the talking, oh my dear
Ain't no other word for it, just another word for it
Oh, he says you know what you gotta do
I'm gonna change my mind
I'm gonna change my mind
I hope they think of me
You know what I mean
Look, nobody's ever gonna tell me I've been a fool
You may think I've been pretty on my last trip with these kids
It never made me happy, I guess you should think that way
You've been trying to change my mind
You've been trying to change my mind
"You should think that way"
Well, I hope that change was worth it
Well, if I didn't know better
Well, if I didn't know better
Well, if I didn't know better
My friends would probably say to me, 'Well, that's a good thing
Well, if you're an outcast and you're just a kid
Well, I'm an outcast and all those people would say to that
Well, maybe you should change your mind

Well, maybe you should change your mind
Well, maybe you should change your mind
Well, maybe you should change your mind
Well, maybe you should change your mind

I am the only girl in this world who doesn't have regrets
And I have some pretty big plans to show you
If I didn't know better

Nowhere else is it a stranger
'Til you come close

'Cause I'll come to you if you're on your knees

'Cause I'll be right there for you
'Cause I won't be leaving
And I'll never forget what you made me do
You never ask, you'll never ask

You never ask for forgiveness
I know you'll have to repay us someday
You never ask for love
I know you won't have to wait another day
I know you won't feel as old as when I died
You want to change everyone's lives, you want to change how you look at someone else
You're what I was for you; my love; your promise
When I'm gone, you'll be back
Everything I fought for you
When I'm gone, I can't do
Everything I had for you now
I'm here for all of you with this song
To remember you with a smile
And keep you all together
I hope I won't need your hand again
If you're waiting for me
Let me know who you're hanging out with
'Cause I'm waiting
Let me see your face
Oh, all you lonely people
Are you a bad boy
I used to say, 'You don't need to change my mind
When I'm gone, if you ever need any help
I'll take care of you
With no words shall I curse you
Let you have a life filled with dreams,
And dreams filled with hate
With a life filled with hate
I won't change who you are, you're my baby
You're mine and my baby's mine alone
You won't change who you're hurting me for you
And I won't change who you're hurting me for you
I ain't a man of my word
I said so plainly
Yes, he did
And I'll prove it to you someday
I'll tear them down and make them whole
I'll make their lives better for all of us forever
I'll make all the people I hurt in order
If that's what it takes
The world out there loves me for what I do
The people who hate me for what I do
I'm still a woman alive
I don't have all the answers
I'm still a man I need answers for
And I'll change everything for anyone that stands in my way
I wish I had more love than I have
I've had the luxury of never thinking I'd ever see again
To be loved by so many people and loved forever by so few
I love this world more than any other
If that's what it takes
The world out there loves me for what I do
I'm still a woman alive
I don't have all the answers
I'm still a man I need answers for
And I'll change everything for anyone that stands in my way!
Love the Girl
A love that we share together
We're the same age, we're the same age.
Yes, she knows it all, she's just never felt the same.
She's a nice girl, a nice girl she can be
She's always there helping you out, she'll never take your hate away.
I hope she stays with you when she gets older.
She's mine forever, I promise she'll turn this thing around.
Love never makes me sad
Love's all about the things you love, how you've loved them
When you're old, I love you back, I want you to remember me forever.
But keep these words to yourself, love will never make you sad.
She's mine forever, I promise she'll turn this thing around.
Love never makes me sad
All men don't know it all
All men don't know how to love, love never changes, love never makes you sad.
I know it all, I'm mine forever, I promise her I'll turn this thing around.
Love never makes me sad
She's mine forever, I promise she'll turn this thing around.
Oh, and that girl on the beach, when you saw her
When she came in, she had her little baby, how could you not be so happy?
Oh, and that guy on the bus, he got out of the train when we got off the bus
That one time you saw her in your heart, she was on your way back to the house
She looked so young, she was about to cry, but she stopped and said, "Dad, what do I have for me?"
He said, "Well you can't see that baby on the beach."
"Uh huh," she said, she opened the door, closed it, she kissed him, he took his stuff.
'Cause she was a happy girl, she looked happy, she looked like she'd grown old, she told herself all the time
And I'll never forget

 the good old days, and there's a lot more money to be made at making a living in a field of pigs and ley lines than in shoveling and shoving a ton of hay together and living in the shadow of all the people who just took over the place and how it makes you shabby.

I'm a grown woman, so I know when I start to cry. That's the way it goes in the world.

Oh yeah, and you have to keep the kids on their own, or you might break your hand or something.

Here's to trying to make ends meet in life.

Kaitlin
I got all this and the life I really had when we were kids was nothing compared to the things that it put me through. I mean, you had to keep the kids on their own, you got to keep the kids on their own and now you're stuck with nothing.

I can't even imagine how it's gonna feel today.

I didn't grow up eating so much chicken in a day, I guess it's kinda self-righteously so.

We didn't even have to wear my perfume on our nappy for a good ten years, it's all in the way, the way, the way that we made the world a better place.

In all that time, I'm sure we could have used our marriage and our love better by leaving it up to these hard-working people.

Oh, and there's another way of thinking about it would be to say goodbye to our lives.

We may not really be together anymore, but all the good things that have been left of us still feel great.

I got to say goodbye to my dog just as I was doing some soul searching a man did all the same year
For he was a good boy, a baby to a loving wife
And a sweet child to a happy father
And now he's calling me, calling back my calls
That last thing he thought about us when he had dinner together last night
Was when he saw us all with a happy, proud smile
And all I could think about was our old dogs, all those years ago
And we could all live a blissful life together
I'm sure we can do that for some time to come
And I know there are some people that do that
And all the good things that have been left of us still feel great
But it doesn't mean we should quit trying
If we can make it to the big leagues
No matter where we may land
Or the world to save us from
And I'm sure that if we all just keep on trying
We all can reach our full potential
And we all can play the game the way we love
And all that's left of you is lonely, lonely
Is pretty much it all for the better in a world that needs us
I know there are some people that do that
And every time they do it's pretty much it

And that's just the way it is

I've got a secret
I've got to do this again
I've got to do a little bit more
As long as I'm around
Yeah, I know it can be hard sometimes
But that's only the price we have to pay
I've got to do as much as I can take
That's the only way to go
With just a little bit of hard work
It's all worth the wait
I know a secret
I've got to do this again
I've got to do a little bit more
I know this feeling is real
Yeah, it is, you should try and make this even mean
Well, maybe try harder.
It's all worth the wait
I know this feeling is real
Yeah, it is, you should try and make this even mean
Yeah, maybe try harder.
I said I know
I said
I said

I say goodbye to my past
I said I don't need to move on
But maybe change is in the air
If it doesn't feel so old and lost
It's all worth the wait
I know this feeling is real
Yeah, it is, you should try and make this even mean
Yeah, maybe try harder

I know it's real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm not a person
A man's a woman
I've seen him a thousand times

And I'll burn him even hotter

Gonna leave a bad taste in your mouth
Gonna give you up old lonely ways

The New Porn
It's been twenty-one years since I last saw anyones body or thought, nobody needs those glasses, nobody needs these things anymore, a lot of people seem to have forgotten the old ways, and a lot of people just don't seem to care anymore. But this has changed a lot of people.

Well, if you remember when you were small, old, lonely, lonely old, we're back together again. We've got your favorite thing you've been smoking, your favorite party you've been taking place, our new baby, we've got your first tattoo you've made, your first drink you've had, your first fancy date, your first wedding ring you sent us on, you've seen in the shades, you know we're all made to look that way, we've even got a million little things that you've done for one another that will make you proud to be human again, we've got the new movie we're filming, it's called "Angel's Kiss", we've got "Baby's Gone", it's over, it's over and we're done with being men that we've moved on to be.

You've had a lot of fun today, don't you?

The world is a better place when you're together with

Father and daughter

Angel started out small
Stayed with a couple
And started selling
The baby some dresses
And the clothes for your grandmother's wedding
And the wine
A little wine
To go along
You never had a big drink
And only a little
You were raised by
Your mommy
But she died a young
And your dad was a tough guy
One day your grandma was found
In a field, and you thought, you don't belong
The world is a better place when you're together with
Your father, mother, and daughter
Your life was a living hell
You had a job
You had friends
You had movies
You had music
You were a-changin', a-dreaming a
Well you weren't gonna hurt anybody
But when somebody really did

Mountain Song, 'Cause We Got a Lot of Friends
Grandpa taught me mountain biking
He used to keep an old hippo head
And you know how that sounds
Mountain songs ain't always gonna go well
But everytime I hear mountain songs, he's right
My buddy from college bought me a ride home
Then he killed me, and me
By the time I could afford to hold my own, he's gone
I know what you're thinking 'bout me, it's kind of hard
"The only thing I can really say right now is 'hey mountain guy'
"I'm alive because I'm and because I'm"
You know what the one thing that makes a mountain more livin'
Is that it's big
Yeah that one 'til it's empty
Yeah my friends, I've got you covered
'Cause I'm a mama's cook
Ain' a mama's cook
Yeah all of a sudden we're an hour away
I'm leaving with a bang
'Cause I got the mama's cook's gonna love me
Gotta love her baby
She wants to make sure she's eating well
And keeps an eye on the little one
The only thing that keeps me going is the way
Grandpa taught me mountain biking
He used to keep an old hippo head
And you know how that sounds

Mountain songs ain't all that often
But everytime I hear mountain songs, he's right
My buddy from college bought me a ride home
Then he sowed a field of corn
In what's left of everything I own
And laid all of my eggs
In a fit of desperation
I took my sweetheart to the county doctor
For some medicine
That I may never get
The one thing that makes me a man
'Cause I know what the one thing that makes a mountain more livin'
Is that it's big
Yeah yeah, that's how long it takes me to warm up to the sun
The day I threw away my phone
I got a phone call from a stranger
Promising me that I'd get the call
From someone that I could trust
I jumped on the train
For the first time since my youth
I changed my life
For the country that I love
And to everyone on the other end of the line
I thank God I was not injured
I'm sure that you know too well
That although I might not be the front line
But our country still got a long way to go
I tell ya, daddy, I'm alive and it's really big
Yeah the only thing that makes a mountain more livin'
Is that

They're hurting me like crazy! I wish...I tried to...I tried to kill you...
And they're hurting me as well...
And I waited...until now
For you to fall...

My name is Alabasta Green
Alabasta's in her late sixties
A blues band that's been missing for over a year
They play a small but packed Seattle venue
And we're missing a whole lot
For another band that we should've been
I sat there in a bandit hideout, naked,
Just eating lunch and laughing,
Like a fool I tried to hide from them
But all they brought was beer cans,
And all we got was this ragged old skiff
I'll never forget is saying to one of them,
Just drink a little water and quit smoking
For I have a name for you 
Who play in a bandit hideout a mile away
In a tiny but packed Seattle venue 
This sounds like the music to a band 
A blues band that's been missing
A couple of years ago 
And I've been on drugs, drink issues 
And some stuff that a broken hearted man 
Could only imagine
Just what it would be like to play in a bandit hideout 
In a tiny but packed Seattle venue 
Wake up Martin Luther King 
Go to church, and make a difference
In a small but packed Seattle venue 
Wake up Rosa Parks 
Think about all the people that you could beat to the punch!
Make a difference
Right now
Do you know what would become of a Martin Luther 
Wake up Martin Luther King 
Go to church today
Tell me about another band that you think might too
Wake up George Harrison 
Think about all the people that you might have
Make a difference
Right now

Convicted Killer on Trial in Reno

Thereafter
Convicted murderer on trial
In December, 1989, a grand jury held a closed-door

prejury

Wake up Martin Luther 
Wake up Rosa Parks 
Wake up Rosa Parks 
I have a dream
It's sunny in Reno
It might rain or it might not
I have a dream 

You know I could see
It's dark at night
Between the sheets
You sleep on my back 
You burn my dreams away
I have a dream
It's sunny in Reno
It might rain or it might not
I have a dream
It's sunny in Reno

Convicted Killer on Trial
In July, 2001, a New York federal court
Convicted the man
Who burned down the World Trade Center 
Who forced a judge
To Say No to His Killer
Joseph Martin Hollander 
Joseph Hollander was not only a criminal, he was also a man with a killer 
Joseph Hollander was not only a criminal, he also was a man with a killer 

We are a peaceful people
We live under a rock
We don't let our cars turn into rocket wheels
Only by our will do we survive
And let us all know that we will
We are a peaceful people
We live under a rock
I was born into a poor, dirty world
I grew up poor, dirty and poor 
It is very hard to find a place, and to love someone more than they are, has this person
I was born into a poor and dirty world 
It is very hard to find a place, and to love someone more than they are, has this person
I grew up in a house of misery
But I am a man of words
A man of tears
A man who says "No", and "Yes" 
I was raised in a home where fear was not a word 
And where dreams might be just as big as results
I was raised to love my brother and my grandmother
And now he's gone
My blood is boiling
I've seen white men before
I can't picture loving my brother and my grandmother
I never thought I would be this cold to men of sense
And to hate my brother and my grandmother
I will not be silent
I will not let my tears bleed
I will never make a scene
I will never leave this home in fear
I will walk to the top of Mt. Rainier and cry,
We didn't build that house for us, did we
I was raised here by men who taught me how to hate
And here I am hurting people I never knew I have to deal with now
I was raised here by men that taught me to be a good man and to live by your will

 passing-on
By the time he turned a corner
They had found Al Capone
And when he turned his back
They had to drag him from the yard
To the county jail for that one hit
That play and by the time I got out
The kids were all talking
Like crazy and they took me in for questioning
When I told them all the truth about me
Well, I was just an old woman in a dress
She was just trying to look pretty on the inside
But you wouldn't believe what she had on
She had this silly pony-thing thing
That made her go wild
And if you took a few steps down that long hall
You'd know it really was her was split
Well, some people never let you in
And there wasn't much you could do
About her life, you know? Well, you know, there wasn't much you could do
About her life you knew well
Was just trying to look pretty on the inside
And if you took a few steps down that long hall
You'd know it really was her was split

Wild Bill
Wild Bill
Wild Bill
She lay dying in her bed by the window
She was so poor, and all she had was me
She was so poor, and all she had was me
Wild Bill, Wild Bill
Wild Bill, Wild Bill

Her Own Hippie
My momma brought me a box of old hippo music
And we played it through the night
Sometime was a little too lonesome for grown men
But they loved the change
Of Song and the way my grandma sang and danced
And all the songs she made while still in her natural youth
Hippopotamus song, lemme put her to sleep just so
And it sounds the same as it does sweet baby
And it's the strangest time of the year
Mommy walks the floor the night
Sheb-law song, lemme turn the lights on
And the strangest part is she's still a girl
All day long she's in the cotton room talking to me
With her fingers all the way through the story
So grandma makes me some hippopotamus perfume
And while she's making make-up for the boys
She says she only likes to spend her days alone
As a flower for the night
And when the hippopotamus goes away
They hang her flowers all night
All night long she keeps these precious paintings
On her hip
Where we used to hang out
And now they've been taken off of her
There's been so much trash and so much hate
To fill this small home
Without all the help I can give
Now it seems only natural that someone should come
And fill this little home
With the things that just won't stop hurting
But no, no, no, no
No more lies, no more sin, no more incest, no more all the things that make you sad
Yes, you little brat
You're my only hope now
All of your troubles and all the troubles
I've had to show you
So you think you can go around some people
But they all know you're just a piece of cake
And they just keep on going
They never seemed to catch on
And it's just too much of me
So what do you think?
Merry Christmas, sweet sweet Christmas

Tumblewood Footsteps
Well, I was just a very tall fool
And I crashed my high school slide night
On a Sunday morning
When nobody could stop their jog
I skied across the line of fire
Just for a moment, and then I
Took a deep breath and dropped
The dime into the black hole
That memory will never leave me
I came home cold, hard first
When I thought about you today
It was as bad as I thought it would be
I'm tall for a high school senior, yeah
Pig groomer hogs need no oil well
Hip to go, man!
My single man hip needs no iron bar
And my two man hip is wide open
And my purse is small
My alp is full of cash
And my tattoo is full of burritos
Money makes a woman happy
And that's what I like about you, Tiny Tim
Well you look a lot like I do
I'm tall for a high school senior, yeah
Pig groomer hogs need no oil well
Hip to go, man!
My single man hip needs no oil well
Hip to go, man!
Lemon Road, my gal
My gal lives all by herself
Kiss me without clapping
Kiss me without flapping
Sitting on me in her golden brocade shawl
I've had my chances, her lucky, my long road
She's a long way down the path of least resistance

From the inside out, they're a pretty good band
If the drummer's a saint
And everyone else a bogeyman
There's a fair bit of mystery to be found
In this world of radio silence
And loneliness, there's no radio silence

#The Way We Tell Them Tried & True
In Styx's band comes a woman
Who's got all the traits of a mother
And who can blame Them when it's time to cut ties
With a band as small and dandy as this

We tried and true love works Well, not as well as Woman, don't We
Tell Them Told You So Well
Like a charm, it's hard to tell who's around
And what makes people like who What keeps a man cold is their fear
Like magic in play and music
Like we tried and true love does
Well sometimes we fade and all that remains is a flame
Like a lonely mother who'll never know
We're the ones that says love is a curse
Like the Bible says do unto others what you should not
Like Jesus said love is a key to peace
Like the Bible says take comfort in someone other than God
Like songs about angels and the saints
Like the Bible says one who's fat or too fast
Or a man in his forties
Like songs about love, mercy and Jesus
Like songs about angels and the saints
Like the Bible says love is a curse
Like the Bible says take comfort in someone other than God
Like songs about love, mercy, and Jesus

Blue Eyes Crying in the rain
I wanna go to the movies
See Stranger in Cheers
And see the world from Blue Eyes' point of view
Blue Eyes Crying in the rain
I wanna cry one more time

Is shaped by his mane
Can't decide between his rock and roll
Dance or sing
Can't help but smile
Maybe that's what makes me Cowboy

Being a man and a cowboy, not a girl

She ain't done as much as she used to
Funny how blue eyes cry all the time
Maybe she's just not that into blushing
It's better to fall in love in a park than to move on
This old blues song
You just wanna leave me but I still love you
I don't need no social out-groups
On the go
If I need a little social out-groups
On the go
Tonight's too good to be true
Tonight's too bright to be
You're my social out-group
Sure is, yeah it is
Yeah it is, yeah it is
Yeah it is, yeah it is

======== SAMPLE 3 ========
 dusty, black, concrete jungle, where all the beasts ride, and all men die a sad death

Whoa-oh-oh! that's the sound of asphalt shatterin'
All the way through to eternity, when all night long it ain't too shabby
It's the sounds of bones raking in the streets of Chicago
Yeah, but it's the silence
Like the emptiness that some say makes it hard to feel
Like an unrequited love

Young Folks
I was raised in a shingle cab, a Chicago shack, and now I Roll with the Tide
Watters the Moon in the West Texas Morning
Desperados of all colors come to Eureka Valley
Dance along on a wave of a million lols
When the mighty will give way to the wild and the lazy
We'll just be another generation of cowboys
That ain't fit to stand in the line
On a swindle made all along the coast of Mexico
Yeah, it's over, baby; it's over, baby
Straight outta Compton, it's a wave of a million lols
Straight outta 'em doin' it again
Some people stay, some don't, but that ain't a reason
To turn a well made dime profit
The hardcore out there ain't many
They may call them out on their low self-esteem
They may say, "hey look niggas, we were definitely gettin' started on our lives'
But that wave got you dancin' down the East River
Not far from here, Texas"
I remember back in the day, we didn't even have a phone
We used to get a little push-in from time to get an order
Back then, you had to go into a store and pick up two things
That's what you got on our end
If you were a lady that had a phone, you could call your momma
And she'd answer the door and pick you in
If you had one thing that made you proud, that nobody else had, was a phone
Back then, you could walk into a store and pick up two things
That kind of made a difference
Back in the old days, when there was no storehouse heavy handed
And everything was done in back of ATV, you could just grab your lunch
And you were good to go
Nowadays, you gotta grab your lunch too
One of the things that sticks out about a lady that I know
That I didn't even know I had
The old 'n' the new like nobody's around
And it really makes me proud
You can tell by the way that I thought about you before
You wonderin' what makes a lady that much more
You might think that a lady that I didn't know was living it up
This old black lady lived her life just like she used to
Back then, everybody was just this dirty game
Now everybody looks the same and everything is so much better
You'd hear the talk of the street, the talk of the place
And the woman on the other hand was just a busy lady
She didn't really mind that she had to travel so much
She just did what she had to do and had to
"Just livin' 'til you get there"
Yeah, it's just a million things that go inside a person
That makes a lady that much more
Back in the old days, yeah, maybe not anymore
But when you think about it, it's all worth livin'
As long as you're a lady that a lady is
Living it up is all that goes inside a man
A lady that a lady is
A living legend
<|endoftext|>As reported by CNN, over on the F-Network, the girls from the band called the police just to say that they saw a man and were "somewhat surprised" to hear he was in possession of a firearm , and had seen his name on the bill. When they looked into it, it seemed that he was actually a masked man, and that he might be able to help, and ended up buying a " bandana " for the bandit men.
 
   
The boys shook their heads and walked away, wondering what had happened to me of all this? 
Another reader managed to found a bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit bandit

He had a beard that was long, he had a ponytail that hung down high
It was summertime in Chicago and my brother was out working
And he thought about me when he thought about him
And he said
Why don't you come alone
And I'll bear you while I can
And then we can have a mama's peace
Or maybe we won't have to be
The happiest woman in the whole room
And I'll just be nanny
The happiest little girl
Oh, Mama Gandhi would've thought of that
Mama
Well, I guess it makes me happy that I'm still so young
When you're a child, there was no need anymore
There was no need anymore
Well, you're talking about spheres
You know, it's so nice to be able to play
And oh, I can breathe in the sunlight
Oh, the Northern Lights
Are a little too late
You know, Mama Gandhi thought
Never had so much sunshine
There was never any doubt
That you were born this way
And there's no need anymore
Oh, there's no need anymore
I'm just a person, honey
If I get the chance
I'll just as easily become
A person like you, Honey

No, no, no
Mercy, no
Am I the only one, mama
How many times have you seen Mr. Robinson
Standing beside the-car
In the summer sun he'd be breaking the windows
He was an amazing man
But only in HarperPanes
now he loved me too much

Fascinating how insecurities some teenage boy
Was still-conscious
To be honest, about
The least
I'm sorry for if
Even though
You know I've got a lot on my mind
And mama might as well sell
The tires on this lorry

LITTLE LITTLE

Yeah, I know, baby
You got a heart of gold
You're beautiful but you're slumberin'
You're pitiful but you're still giveth
You're precious but we're not even half way there
We could all get along just some more stone
Some day when we all stand shoulder to shoulder
We get a little respect and a little respect only a true gentleman
Has he left honest in a livin' chapter
Well it seems he's outlivedages
He goes by the aliases Milhouse & Jones
Who were your friends when you were a young man
And now you dupes him into thinking
That we could all get along just some more stone
Some day when we all stand shoulder to shoulder
We get a little respect and a little respect only a true gentleman
Has he left honest in a livin' chapter
Well it seems he's outlivedages
He goes by the aliases Milhouse and Jones
Who were your friends when you were a young man
And now you dupes him into thinking
That we could all get along just some more stone
Some day when we all stand shoulder to side to say
Well it seems he's outliving your friends
Some day it seems he's outliving your friends

The Dream Come True
Well, I came to this country on a Dream,
You know I could have made in this kitchen
And said I could do this town
So many things here I could not do
All since I can remember is
When I was young I likewind
Mined and burned wild apples
Saved money by pawning carols
Made in the factory
And hey man it's only got more
You tell me why
The truth will follow
When you get your tree you after
The Dream Come True is back
 Neal Adams, born
In the summertimeNow livin' in peaceNow dreaming in delusion
Is better than everWhen you get your tree you after
The Good, the Eternally Bad
Yep to that green light
Can't get me the cab anymore
Can't get me the lightFine mesh coatI got that sharp edge
That smile that once held me back
Is no longer hard-onin'Nacho bread
Is good for you, you know, like a lady
If I evolved quickly
I'd be anywhere from seven to ten years old
When I got my britches
And fat, bulky
It meant so much to me
You know I can't go on in this tale


Never Let You Satisfy Your Guts

Sometimes a person is just some innocent and kind
Just some silly piece of fruit
On their salad or in a cheese dip
On a plate of sushi or at a friend's
Even though they told you not to
To use them said words that could mean the
FUCK ALL

Overdose

If you step over that bumpy line
And you think, I hope this doesn't
I wish I was here

'Cause I couldn't give
That road down
Wasn't nice
My first taste of meth
And poison oak
Yes, that's the word
It's been so long
That I overused
All the years
Of our marriage
To say
That this marriage is done
Eternal life or hell?"
Lord, I hope you don't let that crazy idea fly
Around
Any time, any day
Lord, this house is our home
Lord, nothing can keep me stuck here
Lord, I pray you don't let that crazy idea swing
Around my momma don't let that crazy idea swing
Around this world don't let it go
That way of thinking
Is overbearing
Lord, I pray you don't let that crazy idea swing
Around my dad don't let it leech
On to your next target
Addiction rehab or something
You could do both
But now you have the 'cue addiction hit
Oh, and alcohol
This opioid 'n snus '93
Would break this woman
Her meds and her counseling
And her antidepressant patches
Would straight up do the trick
For some of these women
I spoke to today
Some of these women
Said they were surprised to learn
That a drug they love is now laced
With a very real possibility
That their lives have just turned upside down
And that their loved one

Could very well become the first US soldier to be killed in action in his country
In an act of US aggression
This well off couple has been forced
To Negotiate a Low price
For a drink of wine'
The woman next to her
Could prove to be a very successful negotiation
So long as she can negotiate
With the man in red
If she signs away his right to free speech
She could end up in prison
If

It's one way or the other to hear Tom Sawyer, the poet, son of a rich man and a widow.
See the blackboard? It's called Tom Sawyer's Pen and it's big!
Yeah, he wrote a thousand hymns, a thousand little songs, oh really, about love, dying a happy man's death, and the ocean's call o' the wick.
He wrote so many hymns, a thousand songs, o'clock in the dark sittin' on the holodeck sunup on a Saturday night, oh really, about love, dying a happy man's death, and the ocean's call o' the wick.

There's a girl in the kitchen with a saw to her head, and there's a can of soda in the corner, and there's a can of beer on the table
Oh really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really 

She says, Sweetie, who is she?
I don't know, she's a-gone-unnngh
It's a long way from my native Ohio
She's a long way from a life of crime
That I never dreamed I'd have
But there's a skin in her blue that says,
"I didn't just make this up
I made this up for a long time
In my life I'll be proud
And proud will be my color
I'llow the pale blue
Will do for wimpy hillbillies
When I come home it'll be dark and sordid
Will beley piddle the long drawn out line
The last one gonna get the ball
The last one gonna miss
The last one gonna get the ball
Oh really, really, really
Oh really, really, really, ever


A Kiss for the Sailor
It's June
I'm behind bars
All I'm feeling for you is on my hands and knees
On a letter I'm writing to you
From your faithful mail man
This is Don Juan
It's December
A kiss for the Sailor
It's a few more months until you get your wish
It's a few more months until you get your wish
And it's a few more...
A Kiss for the Sailor


Harper's Special
Shine on me
Pull me away from my rock and roll
Desperados pour themselves low
Then rooftop deck ridein'
Fly this city red
Harper's Special
I'll spare no expense to find a rooftop apartment
Take me to the top of your game
If you're feeling generous
That's what I'll give you
Get me a hotel room and a keg of beer
Or a rooftop deck chair
I'll do the heavy lifting
Take me to the top of your game
I'm an alcoholic with high spirits
Call me crazy if you like me to heart
But drive me to what may or may not be legally recognized
Fly this city red
Make me a high-traffic four-wheel drive
My three-year contract will run you around
And keep me busy whenever it's called
That keg of beer
Or the rooftop deck chair
I want what I have
And I don't need no dealer in this
Hate to brighten the dim dim
My heightened drive home
I've got a city red
I've got a high-traffic four-wheel drive
Jump off the great pyre
I the proud citizen
I'm not a product of any foreign country

Women Are What Make Me Rich
I bet there's talk of straight-up riches being made off the handouts
Well, that might sound good on paper
But really, the men's handouts make a whole lot of sense
If everybody had to make their own money and were paid just like everyone else
They probably wouldn't make a thing at all
And many people still find themselves in the hole they're in
I'm talking about you, the people under my thumb
If you're the first one off my paycheck
Then maybe you'll learn to love my body and keep it strong
If that heart you had when you were my wife makes me hoover every day
Gotta keep my hand free when I grow old, oh yes!

 this
Well, that day was sunny
And Mama said, "Lord, we don't know
How long we've been friends"
And we didn't know
How many times she told us
"When you get to see the ocean
You'll see it all"
And we didn't know
But then she said, "Heaven forbid something very
Strange happens"
And we didn't know
The following Friday we were all alone
In the living room
Playing cards with friends
And hiding something
In a corner
Walking alone
Nothing much happened
While we waited
For the train
We didn't know
When the window would not open
We tried calling the police
But they didn't come
Calling the Federal Guard
And they were too late
We were just toolon
You'll see in a minute
When we wait for the train
We'll be ballin' again
Without mercy
Police state
And all laws profane
And violence ensues
In a brawl that spilled out of the back
Tears roll down the face of every Texan
Who stepped forward
In defense of society
I said, "When is the train gonna start again
Just for fun 'oll
Dude, I got no choice
But we waitin' for the train
We'll be ballin' again
Without mercy"
Right?



Rocky Mountain Massacre

My grandpa was a bandit, a hard-bladed warrior
He wore his skin like l'até, like he was
He couldn't speak a lick of the law, just passed the law
Smoking pot in the car trunk
He said, "When I woke up, I was the biggest coward alive
Only a woman and a baby in the stands
Standing in for the drummer
'Cause we were all so close
Moments later, the bullet tore through my hip
What happened that way? Me and my grandma
Mommy and baby were taken to a local hospital
The pain was too great
To imagine
But there was so much more I didn't know
Could only tell me, "This won't get better
"
Rollin' double shifts are over for me
For a minute I was worried it might go away
But in the end, it just didn't

It wasn't a tragedy that way
It was a tragedy that way
It is, my grandpa said
My name is Tyler, and I'm 28
Are you dead anyway"
And that's it
My name is Tyler, and I'm not fit nor healthy
I'm single, and I'm single
I'm single
I'm single
I'm single
I'm single
Many a bars you'll find a packed house
And find a naked Ursula
And a cowering baby
But on the night you think
I'll just sleep on the floor under the covers
Like a baby on a cake
You'd think someone else's mistake
But someone else's mistake
You'd think someone someone else
But someone maybe else
But someone else
Someone else else
Someone else else

Rocky Mountain Massacre

I got a call the next day from

an old lady who said her funeral
 would be
yours today
Her grave will be laid
by yours
In your own grave

Yoursbank's across the street
Her place of business
Is a living omen
for your future
Oh, you'll be queen of
home
Well into your teenage years
When you didn't have much of an aesthetic
Then youave a 'pussy' party
Everybody on stage
And wore blazers on stage
Well they didn't matter
If you looked pretty, you didn't quite know
And I wore my whole life just to look good
So why don't I look better?"

Dance, dance and tell a story
A collaboration of live tunes
And a little dance music
Can bring
Just one thing back
That you have worked so hard to keep
Putting out
Now, there's no glamour in the music
Or the physical manifestation
Of that most unselfish
Weal
Of all people
Is the feeling that comes when
One feels selfless
To give another something
To feel unworthy
Everybody loves a little bit
Don't they? Cry
We love a little bit
Yes, we send a clear message
That those out there security
Will always love
A man or a woman that love
A little bit of both
For the greater good
And good for the species
Much, much more


Queen of Dance
Was that your mama said
When you got your call
She was a goddess of motion picture
And radio
And radio station
You probably thought you were invincible
But in reality, you had me pinned down
And you had

thin and golden, golden
I am the star-eyed girl
Who is always on the run, just tell me
Sing along, girl
I'm searching for you, I'm searching you
If you're seen with my devil-damned wings
Dropping blue cloth over your head
And your chains don't seem long
Then we'll all be angels
Just like you
I'm weary from all the battles
And all the adventures you've had in yourself
There's so much more to me
If you know I'm away too often
Then you should've seen it through your hair
Although you probably shouldn't
Let me down, then
You're my self-appointed prophet
And I'll show mercy to those in need
And follow my example
Give me a vicious dose, then
A life of crime and bad Luck
Or maybe you shouldn't have seen it
You made my clothes for her, huh?
I wore your head T-bone and a T-bone
And my muscles were strong enough that we could handle a tank
In front of a packed house
And bullets rang out
Allied myself with Killer Crock-fil-A
And friend or foe, I fired
As I lay motionless
In a Mexican jail
Attorney General Romero
Well, I was just a young, beautiful, southern girl
With a big California smile and a Southern drawl
Who loved to watch Motown, R&B and country music
As much as anything else, I sure liked the taste
Of it, and at the same time, I was sure
That this young woman who was my friend
Could soon have a life of her own
And what more could she say
That gona break us up?
But you know those times when youre the only one
That webloviate and growls and screams
And who knows what else that would sound like
Would that young woman be doing?
Well, shev ered that shev ered
That her little bandaged hand was growing more and more painful
And she sounded as though she might cry
You would have been hard-pressed to find an old Kentucky song
Just this one that sounded like shev ered
Could that woman in her song been?
Would that song be enough to change the course
That has brought us here today?
Yes, ma'am; shev ered it almost instantaneously
And that song was sweet and simple
It all seemed soo simple
Would ya be happy to play with us tonight?
Well, yep, we rickety boats battered our boat
And hardin' times were runningtleted our rags
And every nerve wracking thought seemed to turn to terror
Now these are just the facts
Well, yep, we rickety boats battered our boat
And hardin' times were runningtleting our rags
And we were alreadycycling
 'round the clock
Oh, that river rang every house
And we were alreadycylatin'
'Down at the Green'
This old barn gate was high with lumberjacks
And 50,000 acres of new territory
You would have thought that wehippie villagers
These days yon farm would have looked mighty proud
And handawdled grandkids might have been shoving
And tossing stones at dandy trucks
In this dusty old tin cany
Look at that ol' cowgirl lookin' past
Yeah y'all are cretin' Right here on principle
But y'all just grab 'em by the scruff of the neck
Give 'em fast food style
pile-a-group-first
And wine glasses you ever wore
And a bunch about you
Yeah y'all are a-rockin'
And crapton not a thing
Yeah y'all are a-rockin'
And c'mon y'all can't be wrong

Well y'all are just some sort of social experiment
Right, y'all are just some sort of social experiment
Right, y'all are just some sort of social experiment

 he will go on a torturous life
If he can't find a wife that keeps him satisfied
Well he ain't found one now does he? Well he's got a hard time sleeping
And he needs the money
So get on the road honey and welfare, honey
Honey don't miss out on one of these sweet little dresses that I got you
Shining light up at night on the galley
Like a golden ring in one's hand
Honey don't miss out on another one too sweet
That's the one I'm talking about
This one is called the King of Hearts
And it's big and it's beautiful
But just look at it flip up on the internet
It could just as easily have been me
Taking my life in our hands
And turning it into a game
You know it's only natural
That we fight like this
'Cause when we're taken off the road
We go on to do lots of other things
And when we get too close
We take them and run
We win or lose, and that's the end of the world
For we're fierce and we're smart
We just don't get the chance
To nail down a man-on-man...

With so many summer plans in vogue
And tons of parties in the air

I'm just a flower, a girl is a flower
And a romantic idea just dawning to my mind
Sweet dreams she may even have
But what if she just isn't for me

And a sexy dress she's displaying
She's pretty but she's just not as shaven up her leg

 I'd like to speak to you in person, but I can't, and I can't afford the same.
You see, I thought about you yesterday at the Alabaster Ball
Well, I got a feeling that you were gonna win the Ball, and you thought you would win it all.
So you threw the party, and you sent off all the invitations
To it all, and every penny you raised sold out all that day
The more people who showed up to the door they got worse the farther they went
And one by one the stranger's a he from here on out the door
That lonely road you know and love
You'll wander through even after you're gone
And it sounds good to me honey
It's summertime in Tulsa and you're down south watching TV
Have you ever felt a twinge of pride spike?
Well, you know I didn't mean to hurt anybody by cause we had a great conversation
And nowadays we're talking a third of the way through our cable copy
But we don't need your dollars, do we?"
You're a sweet, handsome man, Billy Bush
You have a great heart and a love that is growing in force
And you know exactly how to use every penny of that spending
To your advantage, Billy Bush
Billy Bush
How could a man make a living as a cook
But never more than by eating and sleeping
And spending your days drinking and partying
And then there was the law having me thrown out
'Cause I have an old nose and a bad cough
And the children shouldn't have to grow up in the lonesome droughts
And spend their weekends hanging out with their friends
On their own back yard ignoring the calls
From their utility pole over there
Oh how I abhor the thought
That they might become criminals
By eating right and sleeping just like we do
Oh how I abhor the thought
That they might become drunks
And spend their days drinking and partying
And then there was the law having me threw out
'Cause I have an old nose and a bad cough
And the children shouldn't have to grow up in the lonesome droughts
And spend their weekends hanging out with their friends
On their own back yard ignoring the calls
From their utility pole over there
Oh how I abhor the thought
That they might become criminals
Oh how I abhor the thought
Why I hate men
And why I despise love
Oh I hated all of love
So I'll bet you I hate men
I have so many
My love conquers all
My love will leave no one but me
But the poor I know are left behind
I comb my hair in vain
To find the person I was addressed
What I have is nothing compared
To a wretched world in which I feel as though I'm dead
I comb my hair in vain to find the person I was addressed

The Kiss
You're so sweet, old woman
I've had enough
I've had enough
I've known little old me
And I've got a cruel secret
A curse is a tort to every kiss
My sweet old woman
Get off my floor, I want to strangle you
And I've got a cruel secret
A curse is a tort to every kiss
My sweet old woman
Oh, I will make you bleed, I will make you bleed
I will make you move, I will make you move, I will make you move, oh I will make you move, oh I will make you move, oh I will make you move, oh
I will make a woman's room, and you make it famous
A man needs only to make ends meet
On his first date
To make a woman's room
Want to know what else a man will want
When they put an end to your dreams
And you start calling me
When you get the hang of my
When they abolish the need
For a schedule
And you know you might just text
Mom and pop
When they catch up
On my train
I'm on fire
I don't need no honey
All of a sudden
You're passionate
You want to party
And wild and crazy
And I don't care what that guy says
You're not into your mommy
What I love about her are you know
You're a wild guess
I'm trying to sound kind
Like me
Listen to me woman
I'm trying to help you
But you're just a person
I was made in the company store
To be a man
That was your life
Bother up, silly man
We'll make a deal
You get some credit
For your smarts
And a mouth for your tongue
Yeah baby you got a lot of credit
For that mouth
That cliche I'm walkin'
I got a feelin', I'm rollin', I'm rolling
I can't

I don't need no glad tidings
From the day IASEDweetings
That my darling baby was mauled to death
To save you and your very stones
From one of the most hated nations
Now, my dear girl, how it feels to say
We will never know for certain
How lucky we are

The one thing that I've been missing
All these years
Well, I finally got my wish
By marrying an old False Lord
That is, by helping to unseat
The Pope

You'll get multiple jobs, but none of them will keep you
The ones that do keep you

Ended up in the arms of a couple you despise
And now you'veslipped past us all this love-
This trip on a sinking rocket has brought you here again

 right one
Yeah he ain't the only one
But you have to wonder just how many times
And maybe it's just me or it may be you
I was afraid away
When I wrote that note
I mean maybe it was a feeling
Like I kinda got what I was giving
Yeah maybe it was the bright side
Yeah maybe it was
Your heart muscles are hurting really bad
Don't you think yourself
Should try to keep your mind open a little bit
A little bit too long
Boys are always putting too much weight on
While they're also adding too little weight
Yeah you're crying now baby you're growing tired of us
Girls need some time to think
Time is a wheel that rolls in this yard
And you guys need to start right here baby
It's too bad you don't have a blazer on
Or your T-shirt is too long
Yeezy
You are an adult when I love you
For who better person to love a child than me
Is a senior at Notre Dame
Is still a student at that school
If I had a mangin' wheel
I bet you a crowd could see
You were on that boat the other day
And now you're roamed the world by
But I'm much too old to be
Your baby mama
Go away and be gone forever
Lay me down on my bed
Let my bones shake and my tears slump
She went from being an old witch to being a grandmother
Now she calls herself grandmotheress
You are my woman who is without a second's hesitation
Momo-man-woman
You are my new summer boner
There's a drummer in every high class band
Well played, did you see that boat coming
The Van Halen I've been dreaming Come on, girl
This one's for you baby, what's on your mind
Girl it sure looks nice on you girl
This ain't no penny for wandering amok
This is for you baby, what's on your mind
Cowboy do you know what I think
This is life you're gonna get tocho
This is gonna be hard to turn down
Girl you got mey
Bye bye bye bye
Low key but gentle
This is it, the peaceful retirement
I was goin' straight from hell
All I wanted was another penny to spend
There was so much more I wanted to say
And I've here, and to say, 'no'
To a million thoughts that would have said
Promised me riches that I never got
But I had my mind and I will behave
All night long I was sayin' 'no'
To almost every new gadget
That you might desire
That I may possess
That dream that I have right here in your arms
Is no more, it was the heartaches of youth
When you my wrong you are not happiness
It's time we put an end to your madness
Promised me riches that I never got
But I had my mind and I will behave

There was so much more I wanted to say
And I've here, and to say, no
To a million prayers that I might have said
Promised me riches that I never got
But I had my mind and I will behave

There was so much more I wanted to say
And I have here to say, no
To a million jinxes that I will give you
All I've got is and you'll allude to
There's posters of you in Tokyo
There's posters of you in New York
There's posters of you in your bedroom
There's posters of you sitting on the shore
There's posters of you and your dog
There's posters of you and your best friend
And there's posters of you and your baby
There's posters of you and your little one
There's posters of you and your best friend
And there's posters of you and your baby

You've seen it all
You've heard it all
You've followed my trail
You'll walk anywhere
Youths a woman will walk
You'll read the Bible
You'll think about someone else
You'll have a drink with someone new
Oh, you've seen it all
You've followed my trail
You'll walk anywhere
Youths a woman will walk
You'll think about someone else
You'll have a drink with someone new
You know what's funny is watch your step
You've probably seen it all before
You're widowed and you don't have a widow
You might not be thinking about someone new
You might not be thinking about someone new

You've seen it all

 for it in her heart. Well, I didn't. But... I had my fun.
Now don't I, little girl, make some mistakes, and you'll regret making them all?
Well, remember to take some pride in knowing you made them, boys.

You've got to admit it, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys,

Oh, yeah, 10 times
Baby, 10 times
'Cause you're a sweet girl, sweet girl,
Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet,
All the things she'd want,
All the things a girl would want
If she could fly, if she could drive
If she could walk, if she could run
But these dreams, they keep on coming
Though she's been waiting for him
And now she's waiting for
She's a sweet girl, a sweet girl
With these two roosters
In her tiny little tin can
Oh, yeah, 10 times
'Cause you're a sweet girl, sweet girl,
Sweet girl, sweet girl,
Some days it's as if
We grew up on the same hill
Like the boys were one
Between the two of them
Is it too much to ask
That our sweet girl, our baby
Should we move on
And give her some of her best
If not all of us, would-be sisters
The right to marry
She's got that spark, the heart of a girl
Sweet dreams, they keep on coming
Though she's been waiting for him
And now she's waiting for her

Should we move on
And let her go at last
Of all the things a girl should have
She just can't leave no man
The one thing that keeps keeping her afloat
Is a tight budget
That she's throwing away
All the things she's dreading
When her old man comes knocking
And she's holding back
She's trying to figure it all out
But he's just too cruel
For a woman who's made no secret
That she can't walk
Between two worlds
Should've waited until now
To leave home
Could've left no doubt
At first she thought she'd leave love
But then she saw the world
Spike, the newspaper reporter
Who happened to be sitting next to her
Pretty soon they just became the closest
And they were the ones
That I think I knew
When I looked back at the list
I thought about when I signed up
The last time I'd see
She Stopped to Talk About Love
And Wrote This Letter
Sweet where you from
Before you went to war?
Before you wrote that note
That note said your last word
Weren't there any friends you like
That weren't there on their last trip
As they fought?
As they drove?
As they crashed?
As they arrived at your door?
Don't you miss them so much
When you think about it, maybe
It really does
Come to think of it, maybe
It also does
You don't
just
have
Someday
Will Will
Will
Will
Will
Should
This woman be my wife
Call my place
Call my house
Call my dresser
Everything she's doin'
Everything she's cryin'
Everything she's sayin'
Everything she's tellin'
Should I get married now
And take her out of my way
And have her way
With no one to judge
But you
Shouldn't
This woman be my wife
Letting go of her love
Let it go of her pain
Let it go now
Should I let her go now
Now she can't go no more
Should I let her go on her last trip
Now she can't walk no more
Should I hold her down now
She can't move
She can't walk up to me

Should we have had a kiss
Showed her off on the way to work
And given her a kiss kiss
On the phone
This is my favorite
I hope you

'Cause I've had my fair share of lonely looks.
Old Friends
Strawberry Wine and Mmm, Old Friends. This tea is made with only one thing in mind: grape wine
And strawberry wine
Now I know these old stories don't make me heartbroken
But maybe this Sweetheart that you have makes a few changes
And gives me hope that I may someday love this guy
Like me
Sweetheart, don't let me down
I know you're heartbroken
Byproduct of my lonely heart
I know you're sad
Then you say, "How am I supposed to know
If this sweetheart is helping me?
I thought it was hard work
But they're giving us a bum rap
Like they say 'bout a happy wedding
You're sadly mistaken
Because as you try to find your peace
You start to feel a little too familiar
Like you were born in the past
And then you know that I'm back
As always, you won't believe
Where I've beenience is a charm
And you've been warned
Tough love ain't new
And ya IGHTS
Grandma used to see here at Valley Forge
And a woman's husband can't go
He tells her all the time
"There's always those people in this world that would rather die than see a doctor
That can't be their doctor today
Just because they have a surgeon today
Don't mean they should have it
"And if you hear that cry you're hurting, you're hurting"
But if you don't, then there's that damned damn gravestone
Sitting on top of me
That read "Governer's Bill"
And it just so happen, sits on top of me

That old Cadillac is sitting on top of me
Looking quite the few
And it sounds a lot like me

Cowboy self defense
Clownish high horse country
A Krautrock band covers the beat
Brotherhood and dirt bikes for dear life
They rhyme and they use a lot of blues
And there's not one lyric in every chapter
That says "break my back"
Don't you plead with me, cowboy
I'm asking you a simple but powerful prayer
That you do the same
Brotherhood and thank God
Heaven and earth are my ways
When I'll be gone and you are home
Just like this, before and after
A cowboy band singin'
Another song about a cowboy and his people
A cry for help when they're about to be crushed
Another for you all to take the field

Another drink of strawberry wine
I got a rush of that sweet taste of strawberry wine
Another shot of that grape wine
I got a rush of that sweet taste of grape wine
Another sip of that grape wine
I get the rush, I get the rush
Another sip of that grape wine

I Love Green Pill
I love green pill


Wildwood
I love wildwood
I love the change
I'm not sure why
I don't like it when people talk
Just think of me in that light
Time and again
I'm referred to as "Wildwood"
"He who shuns the Lord can never be saved
He goes on to say "he who dares"
Kiss another, stranger, for you belong
The man who says, "I love green tea"
I pour a glass over it
And let it rip
You are who you love, that's all
I like green tea

, you know?
I had a dream while I was sleeping that I somebody came and took a dove and that's when I remember
The first time I saw John
The man in black
Looks a little more like he could
Have a hot rod
Fired a round from my hip
You know he did

I've got a girl crush
I've got a guy crush
I don't care what he thinks
Just get on with it girl
This woman I know
Loves me, but she's not sure
Just have to look
A mile away
Don't worry Girl, I won't
Keep you off-limits
And make sure nobody is holding you down
By keeping 'em down
And making 'em happy
By 'Mornin' counts
Girl, keep me away
And make me your wife
Girl you have
You and me for the soul searching
Workin' on my mind now
Don't it look like you've gotta have
To have a little bit of love
That ain't too often found me
A woman who ain't no blue jeans
And a little boy who can't read
It's a long story said I would ask
Would it be a happy wedding
If I managed to woo a lady like you
And get her to stay with a man who love and respect
A wedding planner who've got a heart of gold
And flowers on the table
Sure would be nice if they were just a little garden
But all in all it's a happy wedding
Would be a happy wedding, Mama
Make me a picture
Just for you and for you and for you
Say, are you all right
Or is everything just a show
That you love and want to be loved

Well, I'm a lady, I'm a say
A lady is a lady if she's made of something
Like Jive
And chicken fat
And beans
And sugar
And whiskey
And lil' sweet
Is something that just can't be
If I didn't already exist
So here's to all of you who love and need a little help
 figuring out how to live a more happy, fulfilling and loving life
See you on the bright side
Now, if you don't already exist
Then why bother
If you don't need a miracle
Or maybe you are
A Lie, a Foul Man
Seeking out the poor, theitify
If you are
A Lie, a Foul Man
See an old story
About a black man's wife
And he saw a young girl
In a short dress
Playing with a gun
She said,
He ain't here to see a bride
No, I'm here to see his wife

The very idea of a man's wife
Being that ultimate thing
That's so sad
The only thing holding me back
Is giving myself every last little inch
Of total freedom
To desire something different
And more fulfilling
I call that freedom
I want to change the way you think
You want to change me.

#Harper County
(Harper's New)
My grandchild will grow up to be a world-class doctor
And a world-class businessman
Working side-by-side with the best
My great-great-great-grandmother had in common
We were all devastated when
Clive and I got our hold of a chopper
And it crashed into a crowd
In a tragedy that rocked the inner city
Livesurve is still making his sensational film
Industrial espionage thriller
Lost in the ups and downs of your everyday life
You'll learn everything there is to know
 when you step into our hands
The world's a better match for your instincts
And a little something called medicine
Could be the answer to all your everyday ills
But in your hands will come a sick child
And a broken mind
How very sick
Don't you think
Should we kid you or kids you up
So don't take our word for it
Say you'll be making a big deal of it
By now you're probably thinking of those names
And it will just make even more embarrassing
You to know that the culprit is in sight
Could be quite the crime
Your grandchild will grow up to be a world-class doctor
And a

ma's not a bad person
The way you feel hasn't changed
She won't be the same if you don't
And that's the story of Girls...

Friends don't last forever
They may beget bitter people or
Chattel-like people,
But the long-term goodbye

That's implied in every single
 Letter
"Dear Gordie,
I love you and will miss you
Not only for what you put my life in
But also for the way that I feel
Almost tear-freezed by the news
Of your passing
How lucky I am that you're alive
Because I hope you come back someday
And have someone to look up to
If you're someone else's doll
And all the same traits Jimmy Eat World is
If you'll excuse me
I'm really sorry you got so far
And I'm sorry this goodbye
Don't just mean I'm sorry
For you
And for those in need
I've got a charity auction
In which I can donate
The proceeds from the sale
To a number
My wife and I can't afford
Or send off on our final auctions
Before she passed away
Some of you may remember me,
Others may not
But I am very much you
My bestie, my all-woman

Hate to admit it Love is a product of love Love is a product of love
Like cotton candy made up of love
Funny how you love me when I'm not around
So when a man down my roomful
Supposed to be overprotective
Supposed to be alarmed
Supposed to shout at you
When you found out that my baby is here
We were just friends when we were friends
And now we're just friends on and off
And I guess it makes no difference
Who I am or what I do
Lovers love me up
But the people that do the most for them
And don't always stick to the people for the love
Of those that do
Well, they do it by your ways
And by my own hands...

You made my dreams a million years
Happier, fiercer and fatter
You made my dreams come true
You made them and I
Happier, fiercer and fatter

Blue Eyes, Looknin' Evil
I'm azzlier, fatter, and fatter
I get called prettier, smasher, and smoochier
I can wear bigger dicks on my ponytail
I can look better clad and dance better tune-do
I get more and more like-looking
I'm getting my act together sordid tale
I'd call the man in me my better half
I'm worse off without you
If I never get the chance
If I never get the chance
To have my say heard
If I never get the chance
Then, yep, yep
If I never get the chance
Then, yep, yep

Rollin' Stones, Part II
I remember it well
Being in the Vietnam army
If I could just take the bus
And do some of the things
I used to do – you know me
I'd take the bus
Go home, just do what I do
And then you shoot me
You know I should've waited
In suspense, then!
But I waited, and waited
In suspense, then!
Playin' in that color TV movie about a man
With a dream and a memory
There's a guitar playing, and there's a radio playin'
With that famous hit
You promised me
That I'd need all the time
That I might say, "Hey" more

Playin' in that musical, sayin' 'I'm drunk'
And there's a blues song
About a lonely woman
Gotta make a promise
You can't keep
Just make it sound good
You know I can
It's too bad
I couldn't run for Congress
In my momma's place
But I could
It's showin' off, it's heart
And I'd like it to be clear
About what I'm drinkin'
And who I want to be
Something a little too real
But keep it simple, girl
You're toast
I'm a lady, I'm just a substance
That's all
I'll say in my diary
When I think, you're below
I should've stayed
Right where I was, a minute late
But I just can't get
With that sigh
That I got from tellin' you
How I should've waited
In suspense, then!
Playin' in that color TV movie
About a man with a dream
There's a guitar playing, and there's a radio playin'
With that famous hit
You said you were

The Wives
The Maidens
The Shower Light
She walked outside, into the company of dabblers and gamblers
There didn't seem to be much dabbity
Walked with a jockey or rode a horse with a pony
She walked the floor in a ponytail
She walked the floor in a ponytail
She walked the floor in a ponytail
Funny how people walk to the alley and buy the same old
They're probably gonna buy it much later
In stores tonight or in a store a girl goes to
Some places that used to be blue sky and you no longer are
Now they're places like fur stock and Whole Foods
they moved them this past weekend or Monday morning
When I went to the movies there was ice cream on screen
And Felicity Jones was waiting for you
In an old Chevy van she says "Where are you going"
And now she's a fugitive from justice
She left her quiet home in Woodbridge, Texas
With a troubled past to tell
See Felicity and her four grown kids
in a quiet December night
Yes, Felicity loves candy
And does her best to not to say
But no, Felicity won't tell
Her children to do
With her silence so passing
As a present from her son
Said look little they're gonna need
An old Ford truck
Or a Humvee
And they'll be all right
All right, let's go!
Usury, fraud, and hangmen
In a world of fear and loathing
It's no wonder so many people feel
Like they've got to survive
If they're to survive in this great country of ours
So how does a man or woman trying to make
The best out of their hard work
And lowballing their chances

Picks a side of life that you relish
And relishes those golden months
That come with a woman
A man who's hard on nature
And soft in clothes and on Twitter
And handsome in movies and radio
And can't get enough of

I spoke with writer, activist, and musician Tom Johnson
How he makes ends meet
How the DIY revolution reshaped his life
How his band, Redneck Killers, turned him into a band
And helped him learn how to shoot a film
And win an Oscar for best picture
Who can say the same for drummer, Charlie Rich
And friend, Tanya Pacheco
Who grew up in a cotton-wood home
And was the only one I knew
That felt the way you remember
Compared to the change that came
When Tom walked out on my town
I left with no warning
And with no regrets
I called home, cried foul
And walked away with a bottle of Redneck Killers
The only thing that keeps on coming
Is a guitar that sounds like it was made for you
And a beer that's sweet and warm
That I've been calling my whole life
I called my momma and dad and told them everything
The news was that Tom and I were taken off the air
ways
By the time we got on the O2
Wean galley tickets for an hour
And as we drove home
I remember see the white carpet has been ripped
Down by a terrorist
And now we're stuck at the end of the world
I know it happened to you but you just stood there
Unable to hold yourself
You had my number
Yours was make Believe or Die
And I was the last person I knew
Oh, but maybe not forever
How I fell in love with Tom Johnson
In high school we drew near
But he'd show up for church just to kiss lemons
And I learned to walk in the old closet
And ask God to bless me
Then He'd kiss my ass
In a nice white shirt and bottoms store that looked nice
And was nice to look at
When I turned eighteen
I got real close to marrying a successful designer
But shelled up on down river
And she crashed and burned with no warning
'Cause I was single
And her son was trying to get up
Down in the basement we found out
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
The-mammoth-it-was-one-saturday
I'm
