on\n","Won't take up so much yardage\n","Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills\n","Yeah I'm makin' up for all those years\n","Since I've got the pill\n","I'm tired of all your crowin'\n","How you and your hens play\n","While holdin' a couple in my arms\n","Another's on the way\n","This chicken's done tore up her nest\n","And I'm ready to make a deal\n","And ya can't afford

dark it's roostin' time\n","Tonight's too good to be real\n","Oh, but daddy don't you worry none\n","'Cause mama's got the pill\n","Oh, daddy don't you worry none\n","'Cause mama's got the pill\n","You know I like my chicken fried\n","Cold beer on a Friday night\n","A pair of jeans that fit just right\n","And the radio up\n","Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia pine\n","And that's home you know\n","Sweet tea pecan pie and homemade wine\n","Where the peaches grow\n","And my house it's not much to talk about\n","But it's filled with love that's grown in

woman's eyes\n","Feel the touch of a precious child\n","And know a mother's love\n","Well its funny how it's the little things in life that mean the most\n","Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes\n","There's no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I've come to know\n","So if you agree have a drink with me\n","Raise you glasses for a toast\n","To a little bit of

turned eighteen\n","We lived in a one room, rundown shack\n","On the outskirts of New Orleans\n","We didn't have money for food or rent\n","To say the least, we were hard pressed\n","Then Mama spent every last penny we had\n","To buy me a dancin' dress\n","Mama washed and combed and curled my hair\n","And then she painted my eyes and lips, then I stepped into a satin\n","Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip\n","It was red velvet trim and it fit me good\n","Standin' back from the lookin' glass\n","There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood\n","She said, \"here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\n","Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck\n","Then she kissed my cheek\n","And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes\n","As she started to speak\n","She looked at our pitiful shack\n","And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath\n","She said your pa's runned off and I'm real sick\n","And the baby's gonna starve to death\n","She handed me a heart shaped locket that said\n","\"To thine own self be true\"\n","And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across\n","The toe of my high heel shoe\n","It sounded like somebody else, it was talkin'\n","Askin', \"mama, what do I do?\"\n","She said, \"just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy\n","They'll be nice to you\"\n","She said, \"here's your chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","Lord, forgive me for what I do\n","But if you want out, well, it's up to you\n","Now don't let me down now\n","Your mama's gonna move you uptown\n","Well, that was the last time I saw my ma\n","The night I left that rickety shack\n","The welfare people came and took the baby\n","Mama died and I ain't been back\n","But the wheels of fate had started to turn\n","And for me there was no way out\n","And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly\n","What my mama'd been talkin' about\n","I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow\n","That I's gonna be a lady someday\n","Though I don't know when or how\n","But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life\n","With my head hung down in shame\n","You know I might have been born just plain white trash\n","But Fancy was my name\n","She said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","She said, \"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\"\n","It wasn't long after a benevolent man\n","Took me in off the streets\n","And one week later, I was pourin' his tea\n","In a five room hotel suite\n","I charmed a king, a congressman\n","And an occasional aristocrat\n","And then I got me a Georgia mansion\n","And an elegant New York townhouse flat\n","And I ain't done bad (she ain't done bad)\n","Now in this world, there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites\n","That'd call me bad\n","And criticize mama for turning me out\n","No matter how little we had\n","But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'\n","For nigh on fifteen years\n","Well, I can still hear the desperation\n","In my poor mama's voice ringin' in my ears\n","\"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down\n","Lord, forgive me for what I do\n","But if you want out, well, it's up to you\n","Now don't let me down\n","Your mama's gonna move you
