Chicken Fried
You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes

There's no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Mercy
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turnin'?
Mercy
Why you hangin' on so tight if this ain't workin'?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burnin'?
'Cause it's still burnin'
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me, no
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
Whoa
Oh, have mercy
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Whoa, if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mm, if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh, have mercy
Oh, have mercy
Have mercy

Would You Wait For Me

I don't wanna ask too much or be to bold
And I don't want to weigh you down with a heavy load
I've heard you say that you can handle anything
What I really need to know

Is would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

I don't need a magic night to make me feel
Like I'm living in a fairy tale
I know this love is real
Hear me when I say whenever I'm away
My heart is with you all the same

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Looking back at where we've been
Being scared to let you in
You becoming my best friend
No matter where I travel to
I'm coming right back home to you
If you just wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

You are my sunshine


You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine awayThe other night dear, as I lay sleepin'
I dreamed, I held you by my side
When I awoke dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and I cryYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and you love another
And you have shattered all my dreamsYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine awayI'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
But you'll regret it all some day

I was married to a widow, who was pretty as can be
This widow, had a grown-up daughter
Who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And really changed my life
Now my daughter was my mother
Cause she was my father's wife
And to complicate the matter
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For, if-if he were my uncle, then that also made him brother
Of the widow's grown up daughter, who was of course, my stepmother
Uh huh
Father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too
God
Now, if my wife is my grandmother, I am her grandchild, yeah
And every time I think of it, heh! Nearly drives me wild
Cause now I have become, the strangest case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpaw
Oh I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
It sounds funny I know, but it really is so
Oh I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
Talk about incest!
It sounds funny I know, but it really is so
I'm my own grandpaw

Welcome To The Future

When I was ten years old, 
I remember thinkin' how cool it would be, 
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive, 
If I could just watch T.V. 

And I'd have given anything 
To have my own PacMan game at home. 
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade; 
Now I've got it on my phone. 

He-e-ey... 
Glory glory hallelujah. 
Welcome to the future. 

My grandpa was in World War II, 
He fought against the Japanese. 
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma; 
Mailed em from his base in the Philippines. 

I wish they could see this now, 
Where they say this change can go. 
Cause I was on a video chat this morning 
With a company in Tokyo. 

He-e-ey... 
Everyday is a revolution. 
Welcome to the future. 

He-e-ey... 
Look around it's all so clear. 
He-e-ey... 
Wherever we would go and well we... 
He-e-ey... 
So many things I never thought I'd see... 
Happening right in front of me. 

I had a friend in school, 
Running-back on a football team, 
They burned a cross in his front yard 
For asking out the home-coming queen. 

I thought about him today, 
Everybody who's seen what he's seen, 
From a woman on a bus 
To a man with a dream. 

He-e-ey... 
Wake up Martin Luther. 
Welcome to the future. 
He-e-ey... 
Glory glory hallelujah. 
Welcome to the future.

Prepared to cross the line

So we crashed the gate doing ninety-eight

Redneck Woman
Well, I ain't never been the Barbie doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip
'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad

You might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door

“Smoky Mountain Rain”
He thumbed his way from
LA back to Knoxville
He found out those bright
Lights ain't where he belonged
From a phone booth in
The rain he called to tell me
He had a change of
Dreams he's coming home
But I told him not to
Bother 'cause I'm gone
Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling keeps on falling
I keep on calling no need calling
Her name just forget my name
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching keep on searching
I can't go on hurting so now you're hurting
Hurting this way but you threw me away
She's somewhere in the smoky mountain rain
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said he was going as far as gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her can you
Make these big wheels burn, right now
Smoky mountain rain keeps on falling
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling keep on calling
Callin her name but it ain't the same
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching keep on searching
I can't go on hurting I know about hurting
Hurting this way turnabout's fair play
She's somewhere in the smoky mountain rain
I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
Gotta find her no matter what it takes, yes I will
It's too late
Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling keeps on falling
I keep on calling there's no need calling
Calling her name
Just forget my name gonna find her
Smoky mountain rain I'll keep on searching
There's no need searching
I can't go on hurting I'm sorry you're hurting
Hurting this way
What can I say gonna change her mind
Smoky mountain rain smoky mountain rain
I keep on calling, calling
Calling, calling her name
Forget my name
Gotta change her mind

Old Hippie
He turned thirty-five last Sunday
In his hair he found some gray
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle
He likes it better the old way
So he grows a little garden in the backyard by the fence
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense
He get's out there in the twilight zone
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense
Yeh he gets off on country music
'Cause disco left him cold
He's got young friends into new wave
But he's just too frigging old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock
And the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy
And the silence made him cry
Yea he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why
He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust
He was sure back in the sixties
That everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam
On his senior trip
And they force him to become a man
While he was still a boy
And behind each wave of tragedy
He waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more
'Cause he's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust
Well he stays away a lot now
From the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species
Will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo
Just up and fade away
He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust, yeah he ain't tryin' to change nobody, he's just...

#Guitars, Cadillacs

Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine
"How old do you think I am?" he said
I said, well, I didn't know
He said, "I turned 65 about 11 months ago"
I was sittin' in miami pourin' blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' Ironsides on tv
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
"Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
"Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine"
He said, "Women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down"
He said, "I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine"
"Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate"
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine
I had to catch a plane up to atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime
Of old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Didn’t leave nobody but the baby 

Go to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Your momma's gone away
And your daddy's gonna stayGo to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the cornYou're a sweet little baby
You're a sweet little baby
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

Don't you weep pretty baby
Don't you weep pretty baby
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another loving babyGo to sleep, little baby
Go to sleep, little baby
You and me and the devil makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby

Go to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Come lay bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever lovin' baby


Queen of Hearts
Midnight
And I'm a-waitin' on the Twelve-Oh-Five
Hopin' it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight
You're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breakin'
If it's only for a very short time
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Honey
You know it makes you mad
Why is everybody tellin' everybody what you have done
Baby
I know it makes you sad
But when they're handin' out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you ...
Lovers
I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others
They know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
And knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts

Friends in Low Places
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady
I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

Summertime
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lightsSchool's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smileAnd it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertimeTemperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimmin' hole
It's nice and coldBikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

The more they stay the same
It don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah baby when you gotTwo bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford

Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

She's Actin' Single, I'm Drinkin' Doubles
I've seen men look at her before
And they think, I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But, I'm only fooling me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I know all she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say, "an old friend"
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles

Desperados Waiting for a Train
I played the Red River Valley
He'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
"I wonder, Lord, has every well I've drilled gone dry?"
We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
He's a drifter, a driller of oil wells
He's an old school man of the world
Taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like, some old Western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lying 'bout their lives while they played
I was just a kid, they all called me "Sidekick"
Just like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he was a hero of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men
Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
The day before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone.
So we closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang one more verse to that old song
Come on, Jack, that son-of-a-bitch is comin'
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train.

If I Had a Boat
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single
I couldn't bring myself to marrying an old Dale
Well, it'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
The mystery masked man was smart
He got himself a Tonto
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free
But Tonto he was smarter
And one day said kemo sabe
Well, kiss my ass, I bought a boat
I'm going out to sea
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
And if I were like lightning
I wouldn't need no sneakers
I'd come and go wherever I would please
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
I said me upon my pony on my boat

Don’t Let the Green Grass Fool You 
Girl, try to remember
When you didn't have no shoes
We stuck together, just you and me
And it took a long time
To get what we got today
Now ya wanna leave me for another guy

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
It might look greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong

Girl try to remember
When you was on your sick bed
I was the one
To see through
And I know hes feedin' you
A whole lot of sweet talk
But everything shiny girl
Sure ain't gold

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
It might look greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong
Honey
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Sugar don't let it change your mind
I know it looked greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind

People Got a Lotta Nerve
So the saying says "an elephant never forgets"
Standing in a concrete cave
Swaying sad and insane
They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake
Until the lights grew dim
Until the cop cars came
Everybody tells me this is crazy yes, I know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
You know they call them "killer" whales
But you seem surprised when it pinned you down
To the bottom of the tank
Where you can't turn around
It took half your leg and both your lungs
"When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it"
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
Yes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
It will end again in bullets fired
It will end again in bullets fired

#Streets of Baltimore
I sold the farm to take my woman, where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets, she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter, when she saw those city lights
She said, "The prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night"
Oh well a man feels proud to give his woman, what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Well I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night when I came home, with every muscles sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yes, my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

#Fancy
I remember it all very well, lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And then she painted my eyes and lips, then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood
She said, "here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else, it was talkin'
Askin', "mama, what do I do?"
She said, "just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"
She said, "here's your chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your mama's gonna move you uptown
Well, that was the last time I saw my ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later, I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad she ain't done bad
Now in this world, there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That'd call me bad
And criticize mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mama's voice ringin' in my ears
"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your mama's gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did

#Songs About Rain
Well this town has closed down way too early
And there's nothin' to do
So I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on and there's no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain
Well I thought I was over you
But I guess maybe I'm not
'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again all these songs about rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again songs about rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on

Wild and Blue
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your mind all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder honey
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning
And your all alone
With no place to go
Why don't you come…



Independence Day

Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak.
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy'd left the proof on her cheek.
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day.
Well ,word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
But she knew she was on the losin' end.
Some folks whispered and some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day.
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning.
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day.
Well, she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames
And took down some names
And send me to the county home.
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way.
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day.
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning.
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day.
Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day.

In Color
I said, "Grandpa what's this picture here?
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?" He said "yeah, I was 11"
"Times were tough back in '35
That's me and uncle Joe just tryin' to survive A cotton farm
In a great depression
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"
"Oh, and this one here was taken over seas
In the middle of hell in 1943
In the winter time
You can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny Magee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back
Right through the day we left
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
"This one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the summer sun
All dressed up
The day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile
I was so proud
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white"
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, A pictures worth a thousand words
But you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
Should've seen it in Color

Charlie Rich
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say "I want you"
She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me
'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Passionate Kisses
Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Do I want too much
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
"Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right"
Shouldn't I have this shouldn't I
Shouldn't I have this shouldn't I
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses

Coat of Many Colors
Back through the years
I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
So with patches on my britches
And holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
And oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told 'em of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for me

#Mountain Song
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway
Drift away like Tom Sawyer
Ride a raft with ol' Huck' Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle
Daydreamin' again
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway
Swim across the river
Just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day bein' lazy
Just bein' nature's friend
Climb a long tall hick'ry
Bend it over, skinnin' cats
Playin' baseball with chert rocks
Usin' sawmill slabs for bats
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feelin'
'Cause that's where music has to start
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey, hey!
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play
Yee-haw

I Hope You Dance
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance...
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance,
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin',
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone.
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
Dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone.

Angel of Montgomery
I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child who's grown old
If dreams were lightning
And thunder were desire
This old house would've burned down
A long time ago
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
Well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I tried
The years just flowed by
Like a broken down dam
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em there buzzin'
And I ain't done nothing
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
Then come home in the evening
And have nothing to say?
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

The Pill
You wined me and dined me
When I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife
You'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world
Is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearin' down your brooder house
'Cause now I've got the pill
All these years I've stayed at home
While you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by
Another baby's come
There's a gonna be some changes made
Right here on nursery hill
You've set this chicken your last time
'Cause now I've got the pill
This old maternity dress I've got
Is goin' in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearin' from now on
Won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills
Yeah I'm makin' up for all those years
Since I've got the pill
I'm tired of all your crowin'
How you and your hens play
While holdin' a couple in my arms
Another's on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest
And I'm ready to make a deal
And ya can't afford to turn it down
'Cause you know I've got the pill
This incubator is overused
Because you've kept it filled
The feelin' good comes easy now
Since I've got the pill
It's gettin' dark it's roostin' time
Tonight's too good to be real
Oh, but daddy don't you worry none
'Cause mama's got the pill
Oh, daddy don't you worry none
'Cause mama's got the pill

Seven Year Ache
You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking, "Who is this guy?"
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"
Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?
Plenty of dives to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home
Just tell 'em you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"

We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
We like livin' right, and bein' free
We don't make a party out of lovin'
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
WAnd I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball.
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.

I Fall to Pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget to forget
Pretend we've never met never met
And I've tried and I've tried
But I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who love me too love me too
The way you used to do used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces

The Race Is On
I feel tears wellin' up
Cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now, you might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love
Never once suspectin'
What the final result would be
How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
And findin' that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

Lovesick Blues
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day, she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord, I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues


Crazy Arms
Now, blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
And you're someone else's love now, you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

Sixteen Tons
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded 16 tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said, "Well, a-bless my soul"
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Can't no high toned woman make me walk the line
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't get you
Then the left one will
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

El Paso
Out In The West Texas Town Of El Paso
I Fell In Love With A Mexican Girl
Nighttime Would Find Me In Rosa's Cantina
Music Would Play And Felina Would Whirl
Blacker Than Night Were The Eyes Of Felina
Wicked And Evil While Casting A Spell
My Love Was Deep For This Mexican Maiden
I Was In Love, But In Vain I Could Tell
One Night A Wild Young Cowboy Came In
Wild As The West Texas Wind
Dashing And Daring, A Drink He Was Sharing
With Wicked Felina, The Girl That I Loved
So In Anger I Challenged His Right For The Love Of This Maiden
Down Went His Hand For The Gun That He Wore
My Challenge Was Answered In Less Than A Heartbeat
The Handsome Young Stranger Lay Dead On The Floor
Just For A Moment I Stood There In Silence
Shocked By The Foul Evil Deed I Had Done
Many Thoughts Raced Through My Mind As I Stood There
I Had But One Chance And That Was To Run
Out Through The Back Door Of Rosa's I Ran
Out Where The Horses Were Tied
I Caught A Good One, It Looked Like It Could Run
Up On Its Back And Away I Did Ride
Just As Fast As I Could From
The West Texas Town Of El Paso
Out To The Badlands Of New Mexico
Back In El Paso My Life Would Be Worthless
Everything's Gone; In Life Nothing Is Left
It's Been So Long Since I've Seen The Young Maiden
My Love Is Stronger Than My Fear Of Death
I Saddled Up And Away I Did Go
Riding Alone In The Dark
Maybe Tomorrow A Bullet Will Find Me
Tonight Nothing's Worse Than This Pain In My Heart
And At Last Here I Am On The Hill Overlooking El Paso
I Can See Rosa's Cantina Below
My Love

Harper Valley PTA
I wanna tell you all a story 'bout
A Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, "mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA"
Well, the note said, "Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up
Your little girl this way"
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as the mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites"
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA

Springsteen
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
Took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I, whispered your name I bet
Would still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sounds or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Oh Springsteen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Before He Cheats
Right now, he's probably slow dancin' with a bleached-blond tramp and she's probably gettin' frisky
Right now, he's probably buyin' her some fruity little drink 'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick showin' her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably sayin' "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbin' on three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
A-'cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oooh

Dallas
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
Alcohol
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size
Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
And I've been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head
'Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance
I am medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
Yeah, since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
Yeah, I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol

Kiss an Angel Good Mornin
Whenever I had chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face
Any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why, I just smile and say
"You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home"
Well, people may try to guess
The secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speakin' of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home

Folsom Prison Blues
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby, my mama told me
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming
I know I can't be free
But those people keep on movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

The Christian Life
My buddies tell me that I should've waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I still love them and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
I live without them and walk in the light
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
I like the Christian life
 
Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

Ode to Billie Joe
It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Wabash Cannonball
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
The green old flowing mountains to the south down by the moor
She's mighty tall and handsome she's know quite well by all
Regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you travel across the country on the Wabash Cannonball
Oh the eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
In the hills of Tennessee and in the courts throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains round him fall
Would we take him home to Dixy on the Wabash Cannonball
I went down from Birmingham one cold December day
When she pulled into that station you could hear them people say
There's a fellow from Tennessee, boys, he's long and he's tall
He came down from Alabamon the Wabash Cannonball
Oh listen to that jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
You're travelling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Long Black Veil
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me
The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


The Grand Tour
Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you,
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone.
Over there, sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper oh, I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew.
Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we'd lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear.
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart.
As you leave you'll see the nursery,
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but
Our baby and my heart.
Step right up, come on in...

Act Naturally
They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell 
The movie's gonna make me a big star, 
'Cause I can play the part so well 
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 
We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
Begging down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing 
All I'll have to do is act naturally 
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Coal Miner’s Daughter
Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter

Pancho and Lefty
Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
Weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
Ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
All the Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
A few gray Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

$1000 Wedding
It was a $1000 wedding supposed to be held the other day and
With all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes
Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way
I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
Well, he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces
So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud
And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world
And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the desert
Out west of the great divide
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sets in the West
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life that I love best
I want to ride Old Paint, goin' at a run
I wanna feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles from all the city lights
Goin' cowhand's pace
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd
While the moon shines down from above
I want to strum my guitar and odo-lay-eee-hee
Oh, that's the life that I love
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the desert
Out west of the great divide
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sets in the West
I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life that I love best

Golden Ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
She smiles and nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do"
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Waiting there waiting there
For someone to take it home
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old upright piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring I thee wed"
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Shining ring shining ring
Now at last it's found a home
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says, "You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town"
She says, "One thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore"
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Cast aside cast aside
Like the love that's dead and gone
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
Golden ring

Lost Highway
I'm a rollin' stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards, and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly 22
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I take a cost, oh the lost highway
Now boys don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin, are you sorrow-bound?
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway

Bye Bye Love
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'til he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye

Wildwood Flower
I will twine, I will mingle my raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with it's emerald hue
The pale emanita and the hyssop so blue
I will dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portions of loving had all flown away
But he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left with no warning, no word of farewell
Well you told me you love me and called me your flower
That was blooming to cheer you through life's dreary hour
I live to see him regret life's dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

A Satisfied Mind
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind
Once I was waitin'
In fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game 
Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind 
Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind
When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

Sitting on Top of the World
Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
An' you come here runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, who can just kill a man
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
It have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
Goin' to the station, down in the yard
Gone get me a freight train, worked some, got hard
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me and say goodbye
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Your Cheatin' Heart
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

0Hello Walls
Hello walls, hello hello
How'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her
Since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend
Another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company
Hello window hello hello
Well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely
Since our darlin' disappeared?
Well, look here, is that a teardrop
In the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain
She went away and left us all alone
The way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along
Without her if we can
Hello ceiling, hello hello
I'm gonna stare at you awhile
You know I can't sleep
So won't you bear with me awhile?
We gotta all stick together or else
I'll lose my mind
I've got a feelin', she'll be gone a long, long time
Hello, hello



Strawberry Wine
He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
I still remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a hard rush
It's slowin' down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's givin' you now
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowin' down

#Chattahoochee
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.

#The Kiss
I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)
This kiss, this kiss
Cinderella said to Snow White
How does love get so off course, oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss (unsinkable)
This kiss, this kiss
You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, or
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let every thing slide
You got me floating, you got me flying
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this

#Blue Eyes Cryin in the rain
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

#I Drive your truck
Eighty-nine cents in the ashtray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade
Rollin' in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dogtags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a "Go Army" shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy
But that's all right
People got their ways of copin'
Oh, and I've got mine
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust
Yes, sometimes, I drive your truck
I leave that radio playin'
The same ole country station
Where you left it
Yeah, man, I crank it up
You'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down my face
Hey, man, I'm tryin' to be tough
And Mama asked me this mornin'
If I'd been by your grave
But that flag of stone
Ain't where I feel you, anyway
I drive you truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust
Yes, sometimes, I drive your truck
I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
I've shook my fist and asked God why
These days, when I'm missin' you this much
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, and I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust sometimes
Brother, sometimes, I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
I drive your truck

#Die a happy man
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm
Baby, that that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah, mmm
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm

#Guitars and Cadillacs
Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

# Girl in a country song
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's gettin' kinda cold in these painted-on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
(Yeah, baby)
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' in
Sayin', "Hey girl", but you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name, and to you it ain't
Pretty little thing, honey or baby
It's drivin' me red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck crazy
Bein' the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't ever made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time you gotta get you some of that
Sure I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped, huh
These days it ain't easy being that...
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is looking good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Yep, yep, yeah baby
Aw naw
Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw naw
We ain't a cliche
That ain't no way
To treat a lady
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song
Yeah baby
I ain't your tan legged Juliet
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw naw

#If I die young
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls

#Cowboy take me away
I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of blue bonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me
I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon and not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one for miles and miles
Except for maybe you and your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you

#Luckenbach, Texas
The only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society, you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain

#When I said I do
These times are troubled and these times are good
And they're always gonna be, they rise and they fall
We take 'em all the way that we should
Together you and me forsaking them all
Deep in the night and by the light of day
It always looks the same, true love always does
And here by your side, or a million miles away
Nothin's ever gonna change the way that I feel,
The way it is, is the way that it was
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do
Well this old world keeps changin', and the world stays the same
For all who came before, and it goes hand and hand
Only you and I can undo all that we became
That makes us so much more, than a woman and a man
And after everything that comes and goes around
Has only passed us by, here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart in every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do
Truer than true, you know that I'll always be there for you
That's what I had in mind, that's what I had in mind,
When I said I do

#Always on my mind
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
I am so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And gi-ve me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind

Chicken Fried
You know I like my chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up

Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a Georgia Pine
And that's home you know
Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine
Where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

And a little bit of chicken fried
Cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

It's funny how it's the little things in life
That mean the most
Not where you live, what you drive
Or the price tag on your clothes

There's no dollar sign
On a peace of mind
This I've come to know
So if you agree
Have a drink with me
Raise your glasses for a toast

To a little bit of chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

I thank God for my life
And for the stars and stripes
May freedom forever fly
Let it ring
Salute the ones who died
The ones that give their lives
So we don't have to sacrifice
All the things we love

Like our chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Get a little chicken fried
And cold beer on a Friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right
And the radio up
I love to see the sun rise
See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Mercy
Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turnin'?
Mercy
Why you hangin' on so tight if this ain't workin'?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burnin'?
'Cause it's still burnin'
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone
Please don't call me
And say you miss me, no
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
Whoa
Oh, have mercy
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Whoa, if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
Make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mm, if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh, have mercy
Oh, have mercy
Have mercy

Would You Wait For Me

I don't wanna ask too much or be to bold
And I don't want to weigh you down with a heavy load
I've heard you say that you can handle anything
What I really need to know

Is would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

I don't need a magic night to make me feel
Like I'm living in a fairy tale
I know this love is real
Hear me when I say whenever I'm away
My heart is with you all the same

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Looking back at where we've been
Being scared to let you in
You becoming my best friend
No matter where I travel to
I'm coming right back home to you
If you just wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

Would you wait for me
When I got to leave
Could I ever be
Everything you need
If I promise you my love
Could that promise be enough
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me
Would you wait for me

You are my sunshine


You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine awayThe other night dear, as I lay sleepin'
I dreamed, I held you by my side
When I awoke dear, I was mistaken
And I hung my head and I cryYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you

You told me once dear, you really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me and you love another
And you have shattered all my dreamsYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine awayI'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
But you'll regret it all some day

I was married to a widow, who was pretty as can be
This widow, had a grown-up daughter
Who had hair of red
My father fell in love with her and soon they too were wed
This made my dad my son-in-law
And really changed my life
Now my daughter was my mother
Cause she was my father's wife
And to complicate the matter
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For, if-if he were my uncle, then that also made him brother
Of the widow's grown up daughter, who was of course, my stepmother
Uh huh
Father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run
And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son
My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue
Because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too
God
Now, if my wife is my grandmother, I am her grandchild, yeah
And every time I think of it, heh! Nearly drives me wild
Cause now I have become, the strangest case you ever saw
As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpaw
Oh I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
It sounds funny I know, but it really is so
Oh I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
I'm my own grandpaw
Talk about incest!
It sounds funny I know, but it really is so
I'm my own grandpaw

Welcome To The Future

When I was ten years old, 
I remember thinkin' how cool it would be, 
When we were goin' on an eight hour drive, 
If I could just watch T.V. 

And I'd have given anything 
To have my own PacMan game at home. 
I used to have to get a ride down to the arcade; 
Now I've got it on my phone. 

He-e-ey... 
Glory glory hallelujah. 
Welcome to the future. 

My grandpa was in World War II, 
He fought against the Japanese. 
He wrote a hundred letters to my grandma; 
Mailed em from his base in the Philippines. 

I wish they could see this now, 
Where they say this change can go. 
Cause I was on a video chat this morning 
With a company in Tokyo. 

He-e-ey... 
Everyday is a revolution. 
Welcome to the future. 

He-e-ey... 
Look around it's all so clear. 
He-e-ey... 
Wherever we would go and well we... 
He-e-ey... 
So many things I never thought I'd see... 
Happening right in front of me. 

I had a friend in school, 
Running-back on a football team, 
They burned a cross in his front yard 
For asking out the home-coming queen. 

I thought about him today, 
Everybody who's seen what he's seen, 
From a woman on a bus 
To a man with a dream. 

He-e-ey... 
Wake up Martin Luther. 
Welcome to the future. 
He-e-ey... 
Glory glory hallelujah. 
Welcome to the future.

Redneck Woman
Well, I ain't never been the Barbie doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne, I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern or in a honky tonk or on a four-wheel drive tailgate

Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip
'Cause I'm a redneck woman

“Smoky Mountain Rain”
He thumbed his way from
LA back to Knoxville
He found out those bright
Lights ain't where he belonged
From a phone booth in
The rain he called to tell me
He had a change of
Dreams he's coming home
But I told him not to
Bother 'cause I'm gone
Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling keeps on falling
I keep on calling no need calling
Her name just forget my name
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching keep on searching
I can't go on hurting so now you're hurting
Hurting this way but you threw me away
She's somewhere in the smoky mountain rain
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said he was going as far as gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her can you
Make these big wheels burn, right now
Smoky mountain rain keeps on falling
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling keep on calling
Callin her name but it ain't the same
Smoky mountain rain
I'll keep on searching keep on searching
I can't go on hurting I know about hurting
Hurting this way turnabout's fair play
She's somewhere in the smoky mountain rain
I can't blame her for letting go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain running down my face
Gotta find her no matter what it takes, yes I will
It's too late
Smoky mountain rain
Keeps on falling keeps on falling
I keep on calling there's no need calling
Calling her name
Just forget my name gonna find her
Smoky mountain rain I'll keep on searching
There's no need searching

Hurting this way
What can I say gonna change her mind
Smoky mountain rain smoky mountain rain

Old Hippie
He turned thirty-five last Sunday
In his hair he found some gray
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle
He likes it better the old way
So he grows a little garden in the backyard by the fence
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense
He get's out there in the twilight zone
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense
Yeh he gets off on country music
'Cause disco left him cold
He's got young friends into new wave
But he's just too frigging old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock
And the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy
And the silence made him cry
Yea he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why
He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust
He was sure back in the sixties
That everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam
On his senior trip
And they force him to become a man
While he was still a boy
And behind each wave of tragedy
He waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more
'Cause he's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust
Well he stays away a lot now
From the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species
Will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo
Just up and fade away
He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust, yeah he ain't tryin' to change nobody, he's just...

#Guitars, Cadillacs

Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

Old Dogs, Children and Watermelon Wine
"How old do you think I am?" he said
I said, well, I didn't know
He said, "I turned 65 about 11 months ago"
I was sittin' in miami pourin' blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' Ironsides on tv
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
"Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
"Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine"
He said, "Women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down"
He said, "I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine"
"Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate"
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine
I had to catch a plane up to atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime
Of old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Didn’t leave nobody but the baby 

Go to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Your momma's gone away
And your daddy's gonna stayGo to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Everybody's gone in the cotton and the cornYou're a sweet little baby
You're a sweet little baby
Honey in the rock and the sugar don't stop
Gonna bring a bottle to the baby

Don't you weep pretty baby
Don't you weep pretty baby
She's long gone with her red shoes on
Gonna need another loving babyGo to sleep, little baby
Go to sleep, little baby
You and me and the devil makes three
Don't need no other lovin' baby

Go to sleep, you little baby
Go to sleep, you little baby
Come lay bones on the alabaster stones
And be my ever lovin' baby


Queen of Hearts
Midnight
And I'm a-waitin' on the Twelve-Oh-Five
Hopin' it'll take me just a little farther down the line
Moonlight
You're just a heartache in disguise
Won't you keep my heart from breakin'
If it's only for a very short time
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Honey
You know it makes you mad
Why is everybody tellin' everybody what you have done
Baby
I know it makes you sad
But when they're handin' out the heartaches
You know you got to have you some
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you ...
Lovers
I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
And tell 'em they're the only one
And others
They know just what I'm goin' through
And it's a-hard to be a lover
When you say you're only in it for fun
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
And knowin' it ain't really smart
The Joker ain't the only fool
Who'll do anythin' for you
Layin' out another lie
Thinkin' 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
To keep me away from you
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts
Playin' with the Queen of Hearts

Friends in Low Places
Blame it all on my roots
I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one
You thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you
Said, honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's all right
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
Well, I'll be as high
As that ivory tower
That you're livin' in
'Cause I've got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns
And the beer chases my blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
Oh, I've got friends in low places
I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
And everything is alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
I didn't mean to cause a big scene
Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady
I'll head back to the bar
And you can kiss my ass

Summertime
Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lightsSchool's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smileAnd it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertimeTemperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimmin' hole
It's nice and coldBikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertimeThe more things change
The more they stay the same
It don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Yeah baby when you gotTwo bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle rollin' on the floorboardPerfect song on the radio
Sing along 'cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

She's Actin' Single, I'm Drinkin' Doubles
I've seen men look at her before
And they think, I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But, I'm only fooling me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I know all she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say, "an old friend"
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
She's actin' single
I'm drinkin' doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles

Desperados Waiting for a Train
I played the Red River Valley
He'd sit in the kitchen and cry
Run his fingers through seventy years of livin'
"I wonder, Lord, has every well I've drilled gone dry?"
We were friends, me and this old man
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
He's a drifter, a driller of oil wells
He's an old school man of the world
Taught me how to drive his car when he was too drunk to
And he'd wink and give me money for the girls
And our lives were like, some old Western movie
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
From the time that I could walk he'd take me with him
To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There was old men with beer guts and dominoes
Lying 'bout their lives while they played
I was just a kid, they all called me "Sidekick"
Just like desperados waitin' for a train
Like desperados waitin' for a train
One day I looked up and he's pushin' eighty
He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he was a hero of this country
So why's he all dressed up like them old men
Drinkin' beer and playin' Moon and Forty-two
Like desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train
The day before he died I went to see him
I was grown and he was almost gone.
So we closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen
And sang one more verse to that old song
Come on, Jack, that son-of-a-bitch is comin'
Desperados waitin' for a train
Desperados waitin' for a train.

If I Had a Boat
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single
I couldn't bring myself to marrying an old Dale
Well, it'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
The mystery masked man was smart
He got himself a Tonto
'Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free
But Tonto he was smarter
And one day said kemo sabe
Well, kiss my ass, I bought a boat
I'm going out to sea
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
And if I were like lightning
I wouldn't need no sneakers
I'd come and go wherever I would please
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea
And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
I said me upon my pony on my boat
I said me upon my pony on my boat

Don’t Let the Green Grass Fool You 
Girl, try to remember
When you didn't have no shoes
We stuck together, just you and me
And it took a long time
To get what we got today
Now ya wanna leave me for another guy

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
It might look greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong

Girl try to remember
When you was on your sick bed
I was the one
To see through
And I know hes feedin' you
A whole lot of sweet talk
But everything shiny girl
Sure ain't gold

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind
It might look greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong
Honey
Don't let the green grass fool ya
Sugar don't let it change your mind
I know it looked greener
On the other side
But in my arms is where you belong

I'm beggin' ya
Don't let the green grass fool you
Don't let it change your mind

People Got a Lotta Nerve
So the saying says "an elephant never forgets"
Standing in a concrete cave
Swaying sad and insane
They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake
Until the lights grew dim
Until the cop cars came
Everybody tells me this is crazy yes, I know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
You know they call them "killer" whales
But you seem surprised when it pinned you down
To the bottom of the tank
Where you can't turn around
It took half your leg and both your lungs
"When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it"
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
Yes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater
But still you're surprised 'prised 'prised when I eat you
It will end again in bullets fired
It will end again in bullets fired

#Streets of Baltimore
I sold the farm to take my woman, where she longed to be
We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets, she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Her heart was filled with laughter, when she saw those city lights
She said, "The prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at night"
Oh well a man feels proud to give his woman, what she's longing for
And I kind of liked the streets of Baltimore
Well I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
Yet every night when I came home, with every muscles sore
She would drag me through the streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
But I soon learned she loved those bright lights
Much more than she loved me
Now I'm a going back on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
Yes, my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

#Fancy
I remember it all very well, lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least, we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
And then she painted my eyes and lips, then I stepped into a satin
Dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half gown kid had stood
She said, "here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
Then she kissed my cheek
And then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
As she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your pa's runned off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
"To thine own self be true"
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
The toe of my high heel shoe
It sounded like somebody else, it was talkin'
Askin', "mama, what do I do?"
She said, "just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy
They'll be nice to you"
She said, "here's your chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down now
Your mama's gonna move you uptown
Well, that was the last time I saw my ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my mama'd been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do and I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I don't know when or how
But I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame
You know I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
She said, "Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down"
It wasn't long after a benevolent man
Took me in off the streets
And one week later, I was pourin' his tea
In a five room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman
And an occasional aristocrat
And then I got me a Georgia mansion
And an elegant New York townhouse flat
And I ain't done bad she ain't done bad
Now in this world, there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites
That'd call me bad
And criticize mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
Well, I can still hear the desperation
In my poor mama's voice ringin' in my ears
"Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Oh, here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do
But if you want out, well, it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your mama's gonna move you uptown
And I guess she did

#Songs About Rain
Well this town has closed down way too early
And there's nothin' to do
So I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you
Today I heard you got a new last name,
Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way
And the radio just keeps playin' all this songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Now there's all kinda songs about babies and love that goes right
But for some unknown reason nobody wants to play them tonight
Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are
But that's sure not the picture tonight in my car
And it sure ain't easin' my pain all these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on and there's no two the same
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain
Well I thought I was over you
But I guess maybe I'm not
'Cause when I let you go looks like lonely is all that I got
Guess I'll never know what could have been
Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in
If they're gonna keep on playin' these songs like
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again all these songs about rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on
There's no two the same
Rainy night in Georgia, Kentucky rain
Here comes that rainy day feelin' again songs about rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the early mornin' rain
They go on and on

Wild and Blue
Way across town a phone rings off the wall
If you know he ain't home why do you keep callin'
You're gonna drive yourself crazy and you know that it's true
It's making you wild and blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder
You're already wild and blue
In somebody's room on the far side of town
With your mind all made up and the shades all pulled down
Someone is trying to satisfy you
He don't know you're wild and you're blue
Wild and blue it's no wonder
Look at the things that you do
They could just take you up to yonder honey
You're already wild and blue
It's four in the morning
And your all alone
With no place to go
Why don't you come…



Independence Day

Well she seemed all right by dawn's early light
Though she looked a little worried and weak.
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy'd left the proof on her cheek.
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day.
Well ,word gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
But she knew she was on the losin' end.
Some folks whispered and some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day.
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning.
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day.
Well, she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames
And took down some names
And send me to the county home.
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way.
Talk about your revolution
It's Independence Day.
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning.
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day.
Roll the stone away
It's Independence Day.

In Color
I said, "Grandpa what's this picture here?
It's all black and white, and it ain't real clear
Is that you there?" He said "yeah, I was 11"
"Times were tough back in '35
That's me and uncle Joe just tryin' to survive A cotton farm
In a great depression
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"
"Oh, and this one here was taken over seas
In the middle of hell in 1943
In the winter time
You can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner ol' Johnny Magee
He was a high school teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back
Right through the day we left
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color"
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
"This one is my favorite one
This is me and grandma in the summer sun
All dressed up
The day we said our vows
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June
And that rose was red and her eyes were blue
And just look at that smile
I was so proud
That's the story of my life
Right there in black and white"
And if it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Yeah, A pictures worth a thousand words
But you cant see what those shades of gray keep covered
You should've seen it in color
Should've seen it in Color

Charlie Rich
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud
She never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd
'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say "I want you"
She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me
'Cause when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Passionate Kisses
Is it too much to ask
I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up
And warm clothes and all that stuff
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink
And cool quiet and time to think
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Do I want too much
Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
"Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right"
Shouldn't I have this shouldn't I
Shouldn't I have this shouldn't I
Shouldn't I have all of this, and
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh oh
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses

Coat of Many Colors
Back through the years
I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the Bible, she had read
About a coat of many colors
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
So with patches on my britches
And holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
And oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told 'em of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for me

#Mountain Song
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway
Drift away like Tom Sawyer
Ride a raft with ol' Huck' Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle
Daydreamin' again
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway
Swim across the river
Just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day bein' lazy
Just bein' nature's friend
Climb a long tall hick'ry
Bend it over, skinnin' cats
Playin' baseball with chert rocks
Usin' sawmill slabs for bats
Play some back-home, come-on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feelin'
'Cause that's where music has to start
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey, hey!
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play
Yee-haw

I Hope You Dance
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance...
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance,
Livin' might mean takin' chances, but they're worth takin',
Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin',
Don't let some Hell bent heart leave you bitter,
When you come close to sellin' out reconsider,
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone.
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
Dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
Time is a wheel in constant motion always rolling us along,
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone.

Angel of Montgomery
I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child who's grown old
If dreams were lightning
And thunder were desire
This old house would've burned down
A long time ago
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
Well, I had me a cowboy
He weren't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
But that was a long time
And no matter how I tried
The years just flowed by
Like a broken down dam
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em there buzzin'
And I ain't done nothing
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the morning
Then come home in the evening
And have nothing to say?
Make me an angel
That flies from Montgomery
Make me a poster
Of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing
That I can hold on to
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go
To believe in this livin'
Is just a hard way to go

The Pill
You wined me and dined me
When I was your girl
Promised if I'd be your wife
You'd show me the world
But all I've seen of this old world
Is a bed and a doctor bill
I'm tearin' down your brooder house
'Cause now I've got the pill
All these years I've stayed at home
While you had all your fun
And every year that's gone by
Another baby's come
There's a gonna be some changes made
Right here on nursery hill
You've set this chicken your last time
'Cause now I've got the pill
This old maternity dress I've got
Is goin' in the garbage
The clothes I'm wearin' from now on
Won't take up so much yardage
Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills
Yeah I'm makin' up for all those years
Since I've got the pill
I'm tired of all your crowin'
How you and your hens play
While holdin' a couple in my arms
Another's on the way
This chicken's done tore up her nest
And I'm ready to make a deal
And ya can't afford to turn it down
'Cause you know I've got the pill
This incubator is overused
Because you've kept it filled
The feelin' good comes easy now
Since I've got the pill
It's gettin' dark it's roostin' time
Tonight's too good to be real
Oh, but daddy don't you worry none
'Cause mama's got the pill
Oh, daddy don't you worry none
'Cause mama's got the pill

Seven Year Ache
You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking, "Who is this guy?"
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"
Everybody's talking but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?
Plenty of dives to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home
Just tell 'em you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, "When is he gonna give us some room"
The girls say, "God I hope he comes back soon"

Okie from Muskogee
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
We like livin' right, and bein' free
We don't make a party out of lovin'
We like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean
WAnd I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball.
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.

I Fall to Pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time I see you again
I fall to pieces
How can I be just your friend?
You want me to act like we've never kissed
You want me to forget to forget
Pretend we've never met never met
And I've tried and I've tried
But I haven't yet
You walk by and I fall to pieces
I fall to pieces
Each time someone speaks your name speaks your name
I fall to pieces
Time only adds to the flame
You tell me to find someone else to love
Someone who love me too love me too
The way you used to do used to do
But each time I go out with someone new
You walk by and I fall to pieces
You walk by and I fall to pieces

The Race Is On
I feel tears wellin' up
Cold and deep inside
Like my heart's sprung a big break
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
That I may never shake
Now, you might say that I was takin' it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartache
And the winner loses all
One day I ventured in love
Never once suspectin'
What the final result would be
How I lived in fear of wakin' up each mornin'
And findin' that you're gone from me
There's ache and pain in my heart
For today was the one I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
And I came out in second place
Now the race is on
And here comes pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are goin' to the inside
My tears are holdin' back
They're tryin' not to fall
My heart's out of the runnin'
True love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like heartaches
And the winner loses all

Lovesick Blues
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day, she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Well, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Lord, I tried and tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
So now that she is leavin'
This is all I can say
I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
Lord, I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sit and sigh, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lord, I thought I would cry
She'll do me, she'll do you
She's got that kind of lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet da-a-addy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over
I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lo-o-onesome
I got the lovesick blues


Crazy Arms
Now, blue ain't the world for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
And you're someone else's love now, you're not mine
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
And my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
So please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
For my yearning heart keeps sayin' you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

Sixteen Tons
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded 16 tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said, "Well, a-bless my soul"
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Can't no high toned woman make me walk the line
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store
If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't get you
Then the left one will
You load 16 tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
St. Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

El Paso
Out In The West Texas Town Of El Paso
I Fell In Love With A Mexican Girl
Nighttime Would Find Me In Rosa's Cantina
Music Would Play And Felina Would Whirl
Blacker Than Night Were The Eyes Of Felina
Wicked And Evil While Casting A Spell
My Love Was Deep For This Mexican Maiden
I Was In Love, But In Vain I Could Tell
One Night A Wild Young Cowboy Came In
Wild As The West Texas Wind
Dashing And Daring, A Drink He Was Sharing
With Wicked Felina, The Girl That I Loved
So In Anger I Challenged His Right For The Love Of This Maiden
Down Went His Hand For The Gun That He Wore
My Challenge Was Answered In Less Than A Heartbeat
The Handsome Young Stranger Lay Dead On The Floor
Just For A Moment I Stood There In Silence
Shocked By The Foul Evil Deed I Had Done
Many Thoughts Raced Through My Mind As I Stood There
I Had But One Chance And That Was To Run
Out Through The Back Door Of Rosa's I Ran
Out Where The Horses Were Tied
I Caught A Good One, It Looked Like It Could Run
Up On Its Back And Away I Did Ride
Just As Fast As I Could From
The West Texas Town Of El Paso
Out To The Badlands Of New Mexico
Back In El Paso My Life Would Be Worthless
Everything's Gone; In Life Nothing Is Left
It's Been So Long Since I've Seen The Young Maiden
My Love Is Stronger Than My Fear Of Death
I Saddled Up And Away I Did Go
Riding Alone In The Dark
Maybe Tomorrow A Bullet Will Find Me
Tonight Nothing's Worse Than This Pain In My Heart
And At Last Here I Am On The Hill Overlooking El Paso
I Can See Rosa's Cantina Below
My Love

Harper Valley PTA
I wanna tell you all a story 'bout
A Harper Valley widowed wife
Who had a teenage daughter
Who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon
And didn't even stop to play
And she said, "mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA"
Well, the note said, "Mrs. Johnson
You're wearin' your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking
And a-running 'round with men and goin' wild
And we don't believe you oughta be a-bringin' up
Your little girl this way"
And it was signed by the Secretary
Harper Valley PTA
Well, it happened that the PTA was gonna meet
That very afternoon
And they were sure surprised
When Mrs. Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
And as she walked up to the blackboard
I can still recall the words she had to say
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there
And seven times he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice
Whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why
Your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here
'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath
You'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me
You think that as the mother I'm not fit
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place
And you're all Harper Valley hypocrites"
No, I wouldn't put you on because it really did
It happened just this way
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA

Springsteen
To this day when I hear that song
I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut off jeans
Somewhere between that settin' sun
I'm on fire and born to run
You looked at me and I was done
We were just gettin' started
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang Oh-h-h-h-h-h
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
Took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' don't go
When I think about you, I think about 17
I think about my old jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I, whispered your name I bet
Would still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sounds or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago
When you think about me, do you think about 17
Do you think about my old jeep
Think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Springsteen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Funny how a melody, sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Oh Springsteen
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Before He Cheats
Right now, he's probably slow dancin' with a bleached-blond tramp and she's probably gettin' frisky
Right now, he's probably buyin' her some fruity little drink 'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick showin' her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably sayin' "I'm drunk"
And he's a-thinkin' that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbin' on three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl
A-'cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me
'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats
Oooh

Dallas
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
She made leaving me look easy
I wish she'd made it look a little harder
I took her out of Texas
When she was just a girl
But old Tennessee and me
Couldn't take Texas out of her
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
By now she's leaving Memphis
And everything we had behind her
Lord I hope the gold band on her hand
Will serve as a reminder
That true love is a treasure
That's very seldom found
But you can't stay together if there's no common ground
Oh how I wish Dallas was in Tennessee
If I could move Texas east
Then she'd be here with me
Then nothin' else would come between the two of us
If Dallas was in Tennessee
Oh if Dallas was in Tennessee
Dallas packed her suitcase
And drove off in the brand new car I bought her
Alcohol
I can make anybody pretty
I can make you believe any lie
I can make you pick a fight
With somebody twice your size
Well I've been known to cause a few breakups
And I've been known to cause a few births
I can make you new friends
Or get you fired from work
And since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
I got blamed at your wedding reception
For your best man's embarrassing speech
And also for those naked pictures of you at the beach
I've influenced kings and world leaders
I helped Hemingway write like he did
And I'll bet you a drink or two that I can make you
Put that lampshade on your head
'Cause since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making a fool out of folks just like you
And helping white people dance
I am medicine and I am poison
I can help you up or make you fall
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol
Yeah, since the day I left Milwaukee
Lynchburg and Bordeaux, France
Been making the bars lots of big money
And helping white people dance
Yeah, I got you in trouble in high school
But college, now that was a ball
You had some of the best times
You'll never remember with me
Alcohol, alcohol

Kiss an Angel Good Mornin
Whenever I had chance to meet
Some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face
Any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why, I just smile and say
"You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home"
Well, people may try to guess
The secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speakin' of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin'
And love her like a devil when you get back home

Folsom Prison Blues
I hear the train a comin'
It's rolling round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone
When I was just a baby, my mama told me
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming
I know I can't be free
But those people keep on movin'
And that's what tortures me
Well if they freed me from this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

The Christian Life
My buddies tell me that I should've waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I still love them and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
I live without them and walk in the light
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasure in things I despise
I like the Christian life
I like the Christian life
 
Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

Ode to Billie Joe
It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton, and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And mama hollered out the back door, y'all, remember to wipe your feet
And then she said, I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge
Today, Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And papa said to mama, as he passed around the blackeyed peas
Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense; pass the biscuits, please
There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow
And mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And brother said he recollected when he, and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
I'll have another piece-a apple pie; you know, it don't seem right
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge
And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And mama said to me, child, what's happened to your appetite?
I've been cookin' all morning, and you haven't touched a single bite
That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge
And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge
A year has come and gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And brother married Becky Thompson; they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round; papa caught it, and he died last spring
And now mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Wabash Cannonball
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
The green old flowing mountains to the south down by the moor
She's mighty tall and handsome she's know quite well by all
Regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
As you travel across the country on the Wabash Cannonball
Oh the eastern states are dandy so the people always say
From New York to St. Louis and Chicago by the way
To the hills of Minnesota where them rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball
Here's to Daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
In the hills of Tennessee and in the courts throughout the land
When his earthly race are over and them curtains round him fall
Would we take him home to Dixy on the Wabash Cannonball
I went down from Birmingham one cold December day
When she pulled into that station you could hear them people say
There's a fellow from Tennessee, boys, he's long and he's tall
He came down from Alabamon the Wabash Cannonball
Oh listen to that jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear the lonesome hobo's call
You're travelling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Long Black Veil
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed, 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me
The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me
Oh, the scaffold is high and eternity's near
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me


The Grand Tour
Step right up, come on in
If you'd like to take the grand tour
Of a lonely house that once was home sweet home
I have nothing here to sell you,
Just some things that I will tell you
Some things I know will chill you to the bone.
Over there, sits the chair
Where she'd bring the paper to me
And sit down on my knee
And whisper oh, I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew.
Straight ahead, that's the bed
Where we'd lay in love together
And Lord knows we had a good thing going here
See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say good morning dear.
There's her rings, all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Like she left them
When she tore my world apart.
As you leave you'll see the nursery,
Oh, she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but
Our baby and my heart.
Step right up, come on in...

Act Naturally
They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 
Well, I'll bet you I'm a-gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can't never tell 
The movie's gonna make me a big star, 
'Cause I can play the part so well 
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 
We'll make a scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
Begging down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing 
All I'll have to do is act naturally 
Well, I hope you come and see me in the movie 
Then I'll know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally

Coal Miner’s Daughter
Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter
In a cabin, on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field a hoin' corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal oil light
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day
Why I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well, the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then
And it's so good to be back home again
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter

Pancho and Lefty
Living on the road my friend
Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath as hard as kerosene
Weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boy
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
Ah but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty, he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say
They could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's living in cheap hotels
The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true
But save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growing old
All the Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
A few gray Federales say
We could have had him any day
We only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

$1000 Wedding
It was a $1000 wedding supposed to be held the other day and
With all the invitations sent
The young bride went away
When the groom saw people passing notes
Not unusual, he might say
But where are the flowers for my baby
I'd even like to see her mean old mama
And why ain't there a funeral, if you're gonna act that way
I hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
He took some friends out drinking and it's lucky they survived
Well, he told them everything there was to tell there along the way
And he felt so bad when he saw the traces of old lies still on their faces
So why don't someone here just spike his drink
Why don't you do him in some old way
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
The Reverend Dr. William Grace
Was talking to the crowd
All about the sweet child's holy face and
The saints who sung out loud
And he swore the fiercest beasts
Could all be put to sleep the same silly way
And where are the flowers for the girl
She only knew she loved the world
And why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day
Supposed to be a funeral
It's been a bad, bad day

Follow Your Arrow
If you save yourself for marriage
You're a bore
You don't save yourself for marriage
You're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink
Then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk
As soon as you down the first one
If you can't lose the weight
Then you're just fat
But if you lose too much
Then you're on crack
You're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
So you might as well just do
Whatever you want
So, make lots of noise
Kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls
If that's something you're into

Just 'cause you can't beat 'em
Don't mean you should join 'em

Gets a little too straight

And follow your arrow
Wherever it points, yeah
Follow your arrow
Wherever it points

I Want to Be a Cowboy’s Sweetheart
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the desert
Out west of the great divide
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sets in the West
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life that I love best
I want to ride Old Paint, goin' at a run
I wanna feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles from all the city lights
Goin' cowhand's pace
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd
While the moon shines down from above
I want to strum my guitar and odo-lay-eee-hee
Oh, that's the life that I love
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart
I want to learn to rope and to ride
I want to ride o'er the plains and the desert
Out west of the great divide
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'
While the sun sets in the West
I wanna be a cowboy's sweetheart
That's the life that I love best

Golden Ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
She smiles and nods her head
As he says, "Honey that's for you
It's not much but it's the best that I can do"
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Waiting there waiting there
For someone to take it home
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a little wedding chapel
Later on that afternoon
An old upright piano
Plays that old familiar tune
Tears roll down her cheeks
And happy thoughts run through her head
As he whispers low, "With this ring I thee wed"
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Shining ring shining ring
Now at last it's found a home
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a small two room apartment
As they fight their final round
He says, "You won't admit it
But I know you're leavin' town"
She says, "One thing's for certain
I don't love you anymore"
And throws down the ring
As she walks out the door
Golden ring golden ring
With one tiny little stone
Cast aside cast aside
Like the love that's dead and gone
By itself by itself
It's just a cold metalic thing
Only love can make a golden wedding ring
In a pawn shop in Chicago
On a sunny summer day
A couple gazes at the
Wedding rings there on display
Golden ring

Lost Highway
I'm a rollin' stone, all alone and lost
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost
When I pass by, all the people say
Just another guy on the lost highway
Just a deck of cards, and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
Oh, the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway
I was just a lad, nearly 22
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord, I take a cost, oh the lost highway
Now boys don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin, are you sorrow-bound?
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway

Bye Bye Love
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby 'til he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
I'm through with romance, I'm through with love
I'm through with counting the stars above
And here's the reason that I'm so free
My loving baby is through with me
Bye bye love
Bye bye happiness
Hello loneliness
I think I'ma gonna cry
Bye bye love
Bye bye sweet caress
Hello emptiness
I feel like I could die
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye
Bye bye my love goodbye

Wildwood Flower
I will twine, I will mingle my raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with it's emerald hue
The pale emanita and the hyssop so blue
I will dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portions of loving had all flown away
But he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering no misery can tell
He left with no warning, no word of farewell
Well you told me you love me and called me your flower
That was blooming to cheer you through life's dreary hour
I live to see him regret life's dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower

A Satisfied Mind
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind
Once I was waitin'
In fortune and fame 
Everything that I dreamed for
To get a start in life's game 
Then suddenly it happened
I lost every dime 
But I'm richer by far
With a satisfied mind 
Money can't buy back
Your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely
Or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person
Is a pauper at times
Compared to the man
With a satisfied mind
When my life has ended
And my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing's for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world
With a satisfied mind
How many times have
You heard someone say
If I had his money
I could do things my way
But little they know
That it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten
With a satisfied mind

Sitting on Top of the World
Was all the summer, and all the fall,
Just trying to find my little all in all
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
Was in the spring, one summer day
Just when she left me, she's gone to stay
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
An' you come here runnin', holdin' up your hand
Can't get me a woman, who can just kill a man
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
It have been days, I didn't know your name
Why should I worry and prayer in vain
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
Goin' to the station, down in the yard
Gone get me a freight train, worked some, got hard
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
The lonesome days, they have gone by
Why should you beg me and say goodbye
But now she's gone, I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Your Cheatin' Heart
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep
But sleep won't come
The whole night through
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
Your cheatin' heart will pine someday
And crave the love you threw away
The time will come when you'll be blue
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
When tears come down like fallin' rain
You'll toss around and call my name
You'll walk the floor the way I do
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you

0Hello Walls
Hello walls, hello hello
How'd things go for you today?
Don't you miss her
Since she up and walked away?
And I'll bet you dread to spend
Another lonely night with me
But lonely walls, I'll keep you company
Hello window hello hello
Well I see that you're still here
Aren't you lonely
Since our darlin' disappeared?
Well, look here, is that a teardrop
In the corner of your pane?
Now don't you try to tell me that it's rain
She went away and left us all alone
The way she planned
Guess we'll have to learn to get along
Without her if we can
Hello ceiling, hello hello
I'm gonna stare at you awhile
You know I can't sleep
So won't you bear with me awhile?
We gotta all stick together or else
I'll lose my mind
I've got a feelin', she'll be gone a long, long time
Hello, hello



Strawberry Wine
He was working through college on my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge and he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
When one restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
I still remember when thirty was old
And my biggest fear was September when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
The fields have grown over now
Years since they've seen the plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
Green on the vine
Like strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
Strawberry wine
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a hard rush
It's slowin' down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's givin' you now
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinkin' about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whisperin'
The way that she's pullin' you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blond hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowin' down

#Chattahoochee
Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgia asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Well we fogged up the windows in my old Chevy
I was willing but she wasn't ready
So I settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home
Down by the river on a Friday night
A pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love
Yeah, way down yonder on the Chattahochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned who I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love.

#The Kiss
I don't want another heartbreak
I don't need another turn to cry, no
I don't want to learn the hard way
Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye
But you got me like a rocket
Shooting straight across the sky
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, impossible
This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)
This kiss, this kiss
Cinderella said to Snow White
How does love get so off course, oh
All I wanted was a white knight
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse
Ride me off into the sunset
Baby, I'm forever yours
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, unthinkable
This kiss, this kiss (unsinkable)
This kiss, this kiss
You can kiss me in the moonlight
On the rooftop under the sky, or
You can kiss me with the windows open
While the rain comes pouring inside
Kiss me in sweet slow motion
Let's let every thing slide
You got me floating, you got me flying
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this
It's centrifugal motion
It's perpetual bliss
It's that pivotal moment
It's, ah, subliminal
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)
This kiss, this kiss
It's the way you love me baby
It's the way you love me darling, yeah
It's the way you love me
It's a feeling like this

#Blue Eyes Cryin in the rain
In the twilight glow I see
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again
Love is like a dyin' ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I'll remember
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Some day when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no partin'
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

#I Drive your truck
Eighty-nine cents in the ashtray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade
Rollin' in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dogtags hangin' from the rear view
Old Skoal can and cowboy boots
And a "Go Army" shirt folded in the back
This thing burns gas like crazy
But that's all right
People got their ways of copin'
Oh, and I've got mine
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust
Yes, sometimes, I drive your truck
I leave that radio playin'
The same ole country station
Where you left it
Yeah, man, I crank it up
You'd probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin' down my face
Hey, man, I'm tryin' to be tough
And Mama asked me this mornin'
If I'd been by your grave
But that flag of stone
Ain't where I feel you, anyway
I drive you truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust
Yes, sometimes, I drive your truck
I've cussed, I've prayed, I've said goodbye
I've shook my fist and asked God why
These days, when I'm missin' you this much
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, and I tear it up
'Till all the pain is a cloud of dust sometimes
Brother, sometimes, I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
I drive your truck

#Die a happy man
Baby, last night was hands down
One of the best nights
That I've had, no doubt
Between the bottle of wine
And the look in your eyes and the Marvin Gaye
Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
A happy man, baby, mmm
Baby, that that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh, but that black dress makes it hard to breathe
You're a saint, you're a goddess, the cutest, the hottest, a masterpiece
It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams
And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern Lights
Or if I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man, yeah, yeah, mmm
I don't need no vacation, no fancy destination
Baby, you're my great escape
We could stay at home, listen to the radio
Dance around the fireplace
Oh, if I never get to build my mansion in Georgia
Or drive a sports car up the coast of California
Oh, if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby, I could die a happy man
Baby, I could die a happy man
Oh, I could die a happy man
You know I could, girl
I could die, I could die a happy man
Mmm

#Guitars and Cadillacs
Girl you taught me how to hurt real bad and cry myself to sleep
You showed me how this town can shatter dreams
Another lesson about a naive fool that came to Babylon
And found out that the pie don't taste so sweet
Now it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
There ain't no glamour in this tinseled land of lost and wasted lives
And painful scars are all that's left of me
Oh but thank you girl for teaching me brand new ways to be cruel
If I can find my mind now, I guess I'll just leave
And it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
Oh it's guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Lonely, lonely streets that I call home
Yeah my guitars, Cadillacs, hillbilly music
Is the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on
It's the only thing that keeps me hanging on

# Girl in a country song
Well, I wish I had some shoes on my two bare feet
And it's gettin' kinda cold in these painted-on cut-off jeans
I hate the way this bikini top chafes
Do I really have to wear it all day?
(Yeah, baby)
I hear you over there on your tailgate whistlin' in
Sayin', "Hey girl", but you know I ain't listenin'
'Cause I got a name, and to you it ain't
Pretty little thing, honey or baby
It's drivin' me red, red, red, red, red, red, redneck crazy
Bein' the girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Well, shakin' my moneymaker ain't ever made me a dime
And there ain't no sugar for you in this shaker of mine
Tell me one more time you gotta get you some of that
Sure I'll slide on over, but you're gonna get slapped, huh
These days it ain't easy being that...
Girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is looking good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
And be the girl in a country song
Yep, yep, yeah baby
Aw naw
Conway and George Strait
Never did it this way
Back in the old days
Aw naw
We ain't a cliche
That ain't no way
To treat a lady
Like a girl in a country song
How in the world did it go so wrong?
Like all we're good for is lookin' good for
You and your friends on the weekend, nothin' more
We used to get a little respect
Now we're lucky if we even get
To climb up in your truck, keep our mouth shut and ride along
Down some old dirt road we don't even wanna be on
And be the girl in a country song
Yeah baby
I ain't your tan legged Juliet
Can I put on some real clothes now?
Aw naw

#If I die young
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of a man
But it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts, oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh
The ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em, oh
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls

#Cowboy take me away
I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
I wanna sleep on the hard ground
In the comfort of your arms
On a pillow of blue bonnets
In a blanket made of stars
Oh, it sounds good to me
I said, cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I wanna walk and not run
I wanna skip and not fall
I wanna look at the horizon and not see a building standing tall
I wanna be the only one for miles and miles
Except for maybe you and your simple smile
Oh, it sounds good to me
Yes, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
I said, I wanna touch the earth
I wanna break it in my hands
I wanna grow something wild and unruly
Oh, it sounds so good to me
Cowboy take me away
Fly this girl as high as you can into the wild blue
Set me free, oh, I pray
Closer to heaven above and closer to you
Closer to you
Closer to you
Cowboy take me away
Closer to you

#Luckenbach, Texas
The only two things in life that make it worth livin'
Is guitars that tune good and firm feelin' women
I don't need my name in the marquee lights
I got my song and I got you with me tonight
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin'
Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
So baby, let's sell your diamond ring
Buy some boots and faded jeans and go away
This coat and tie is choking me
In your high society, you cry all day
We've been so busy keepin' up with the Jones
Four car garage and we're still building on
Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
With Waylon and Willie and the boys
This successful life we're livin' got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs and
Newbury's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas ain't nobody feelin' no pain
Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas
Willie and Waylon and the boys
This successful life we're livin's got us feudin'
Like the Hatfield and McCoys
Between Hank Williams' pain songs
And Jerry Jeff's train songs and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain"
Out in Luckenbach, Texas there ain't nobody feelin' no pain

#When I said I do
These times are troubled and these times are good
And they're always gonna be, they rise and they fall
We take 'em all the way that we should
Together you and me forsaking them all
Deep in the night and by the light of day
It always looks the same, true love always does
And here by your side, or a million miles away
Nothin's ever gonna change the way that I feel,
The way it is, is the way that it was
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do
Well this old world keeps changin', and the world stays the same
For all who came before, and it goes hand and hand
Only you and I can undo all that we became
That makes us so much more, than a woman and a man
And after everything that comes and goes around
Has only passed us by, here alone in our dreams
I know there's a lonely heart in every lost and found
But forever you and I will be the ones
Who found out what forever means
When I said I do, I meant that I will 'til the end of all time
Be faithful and true, devoted to you
That's what I had in mind when I said I do
Truer than true, you know that I'll always be there for you
That's what I had in mind, that's what I had in mind,
When I said I do

#Always on my mind
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
And maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
I am so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And gi-ve me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind (you were always on my mind)
You were always on my mind
